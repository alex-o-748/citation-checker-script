Afterward, Al Jazeera became the main link between Western news outlets and Al Qaeda's video and audio tapes. Because Al Jazeera was an Arab news outlet, it was chosen to receive videotapes produced by Al Qaeda to spread the message and viewpoint of Osama bin Laden. Even though the news coverage produced by Al Jazeera showed no affinity for the Islamist viewpoint, the fact that Al Jazeera broadcast these tapes caused a widespread perception in the West that it was a tool of Al Qaeda. This supports the claim that the network's leaders are appointed by the emir of Qatar, as the source mentions that 'In 2011, Al Jazeera became a self-described private corporation for public benefit, allowing the network to receive funding from the Qatar Council of Ministers, which nominates Al Jazeera's leaders, who the ruler of Qatar then appoints.'",
