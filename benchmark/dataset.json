Camarota and Karen Zeigler on March 12, 2025 View our most recent immigrant population numbers. T he government’s January 2025 Current Population Survey (CPS) shows the foreign-born or immigrant population (legal and illegal together) hit 53.3 million and 15.8 percent of the total U.S. population in January 2025 — both new record highs. The January CPS is the first government survey to be adjusted to better reflect the recent surge in illegal immigrants. Unlike border statistics, the CPS measures the number of immigrants in the country, which is what actually determines their impact on society. Without adjusting for those missed by the survey, we estimate illegal immigrants accounted for 5.4 million or two-thirds of the 8.3 million growth in the foreign-born population since President Biden took office in January 2021. America has entered uncharted territory on immigration, with significant implications for taxpayers, the labor market, and our ability to assimilate so many people. Listen to \"Foreign-Born Number and Share of U.S. Population at All-Time Highs\" on Spreaker. Highlights from the January 2025 data include: At 15.8 percent of the total U.S. population, the foreign-born share is higher now than at the prior peaks reached in 1890 and 1910. No U.S. government survey or census has ever shown such a large foreign-born population. The current numbers have rendered Census Bureau projections obsolete. Just two years ago, the Bureau projected the foreign-born share would not reach 15.8 percent until 2042. The 53.3 million foreign-born residents are the largest number ever in U.S. history; and the 8.3 million increase in the last four years is larger than the growth in the preceding 12 years. The above figures represent net growth. New arrivals are offset by outmigration and deaths in the existing immigrant population. Our best estimate is that 11.5 to 12.5 million legal and illegal immigrants settled in the country in the last four years. Although some immigrants are missed by government surveys, our preliminary estimate is that there are 15.4 million illegal immigrants in the January 2025 CPS, an increase of more than 50 percent (5.4 million) over the last four years in the survey. In the last four years, Latin America accounted for 58 percent (4.9 million) of the increase in the foreign-born, India 12 percent (958,000), the Middle East 8 percent (690,000), and China 7 percent (621,000). Of all immigrants, 60 percent are employed. As in any human population some work, but others are caregivers, disabled, children, elderly, or have no desire to work. Since 2000 the number of immigrants working has increased 83 percent and stood at 31.7 million in January 2025 — 19.6 percent of all workers. We estimate that 10.8 million illegal immigrants worked in the January 2025 data, accounting for some 6.7 percent of all workers. Illegal immigrants in particular are heavily concentrated in lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs, typically done by those without a bachelor’s degree. The rapid rise in immigrant workers has coincided with a significant increase in the share of U.S.-born (ages 16 to 64) men without a bachelor’s degree not in the labor force — neither working nor looking for work — from 20.3 percent in 2000 to 28.2 percent today. Introduction This report is part of a series of recent reports from the Center looking at the size and growth of the foreign-born population in the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), sometimes referred to as the “household survey”. The CPS is collected each month by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 1 While the larger American Community Survey (ACS) is often used to study the foreign-born, the most recent version of the ACS reflects only the population through July 2023 and is now 18 months out of date. Further, as we discuss later in this report, the ACS has not yet been weighted to reflect the enormous increase in migration that the Census Bureau now estimates . In contrast, the CPS is reweighted at the beginning of each year, and the January 2025 survey is the first to more accurately reflect the Bureau’s most recent estimates. 2 Because of this, the January 2025 CPS provides a more updated and accurate look at the current size of the foreign-born population than does the 2023 ACS. 3 We use the terms “immigrant” and “foreign-born” interchangeably in this report. 4 The foreign-born population as defined by the Census Bureau includes all persons who were not U.S. citizens at birth — mainly naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, long-term temporary visitors, and illegal immigrants. While the monthly CPS is a very large survey of about 110,000 individuals, the total foreign-born population in the data still has a margin of error of ±579,000 in January 2025 using a 90 percent confidence level. This means there is fluctuation from month to month in the size of this population, making it necessary to compare longer periods of time when trying to determine trends. 5 Growth in the Foreign-Born Population Recent Increase Is Unprecedented. Figure 1 reports the total number of foreign-born residents in the United States each January from 2009 to 2025. As discussed above, January is when the CPS is re-weighted based on the new population estimates , and comparing January to January is one way of looking at trends without being distracted by monthly fluctuations. Figure 2 shows every month over this same period with a confidence interval shown around each month to reflect sampling variability. Both figures show that growth during the Biden administration is dramatically greater than in the prior administrations. Looking at growth since January 2021 is a good point of comparison because it is just before the border surge began, and it also coincides with the start of the Biden administration. The numerical increase of 8.3 million in the last four years is larger than in any four-year period in American history. 6 The 8.3 million increase in the four years from January 2021 to January 2025 is also larger than the 7.9 million increase in the 12 years prior. One would have to go back to December 2006 to exceed 8.3 million relative to January 2021. In effect, the growth in the immigrant population in the last four years is equal to the increase in the 14 years before January 2021. Of course, during the latter part of the Trump administration Covid significantly curtailed immigration, so one can see his four years as artificially low. However, both Figures 1 and 2 show that the size of the immigrant population was trending downward before Covid hit in February of 2020. This implies that some of the decline during Covid might have happened anyway, especially given President Trump’s policies in the second half of his administration. The public-use data files of the ACS can be used to report individual year of arrival data, and the survey shows new arrivals did fall some during the three years before Covid — 2017 to 2019. But aside from the impact of Covid, monthly growth in Obama’s two terms averaged about 65,000, and it was 42,000 in Trump’s term through January 2020, before the pandemic hit. The 173,000-a-month average during President Biden’s term represented a complete break with pre-Covid trends. Historical Perspective. Figure 3 shows the number of foreign-born residents and their share of the U.S. population since 1850, which was the first time they were identified in the census. At 53.3 million and 15.8 percent of the population, the foreign-born population is higher now than at any time in American history. The number of immigrants has increased more than five-fold since 1970, and nearly three-fold since 1990, and by more than two-thirds since 2000. As a share of the population, even in 1890 (14.8 percent) and 1910 (14.7 percent) during what is often called the “Great Wave” of immigration, the foreign-born were a smaller share of the population than they are today. 7 The scale of recent immigration is so high it has made the Census Bureau population projections, published in November of 2023, nearly obsolete. The Bureau projected that the foreign-born share would not reach 15.8 percent of the U.S. population until 2042. When thinking about the impact on American society, it seems fair to assume that both the size of the foreign-born population and its share of the overall population matter. 8 A Resumption of Prior Trends? In our prior analysis we discuss at length the factors that have led to this extraordinary increase. They include public statements and policy changes by the Biden administration, such as the decision to end the Migrant Protection Protocols, Title 42, and the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Central American countries. Perhaps the most important policy that contributed to the border crisis was the decision to release people encountered at the border and not use detention and expedited removal. Early on, detention and removal might have deterred more people from coming to the border. Legal immigration has also rebounded after Covid. Still, one might argue that the dramatic growth in the foreign-born population in recent years is just “making up” for the slowdown during Covid-19. Of course, there is no reason legal immigration had to return to pre-pandemic levels, as the number of immigrants admitted is a discretionary policy set by Congress. The scale of illegal immigration is also certainly not pre-determined, as the level of resources and commitment to enforce the law reflects each administration’s goals and policy choices. Figure 4 shows the number of immigrants from the start of the Obama administration in January 2009 to January of this year and a line reflecting the pre-Covid-19 (January 2009 to February 2020) trend. The recent growth in the size of the foreign-born population has been above the long-term, pre-pandemic growth trend for at least two and a half years, which itself was very high. Figure 5 shows the same is true for the foreign-born share of the U.S. population. At least when measured this way, the resumption-of-prior-trends-argument is not valid. The recent increase is dramatically larger than the already very substantial pre-Covid increases in the immigrant population. New Arrivals. When thinking about the recent huge increases in the foreign-born population, it is important to remember that they represent a net increase; the number of new arrivals has to be larger than the net increase because new arrivals are always offset by deaths among the existing population and emigration, sometimes called outmigration. The foreign-born population can grow only from new immigration, since all births to the foreign-born in the United States add only to the native-born population by definition. This means that the number of new arrivals must be higher than the growth in the foreign-born population. After reviewing the literature in 2022, the Census Bureau estimated that 1 to 1.5 percent of the foreign-born likely leave the country annually, though this was based on data prior to Covid. If we apply these rates, then between 2021 and 2025, two to three million immigrants left the country. Further, there were 1.2 million deaths among the foreign-born over this time period as well. Adding these numbers to growth (8.3 million) means that 11.5 to 12.5 million (2.9 to 3.1 million annually) new legal and illegal immigrants arrived in the country during the last four years but were offset by emigration and mortality, so that the foreign-born population grew by \"only\" 8.3 million. The above estimate takes the CPS data as given; we do not att",

(Photo: iStock.com/leekris) Worldwide, the United States is home to more immigrants than any other country, and more than the next four countries—Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and France—combined, according to the most recent UN Population Division data. While the United States represented about 4 percent of the total global population in 2024, 17 percent of all international migrants resided in the United States. The size, though not the share, of the U.S. immigrant population is at a record high. Immigration has been an important contributor to U.S. population growth, which has slowed in the past decade due to falling birth rates. Amid this demographic slowing, immigration accounted for the entire growth of the total U.S. population between 2022 and 2023—the first time this has happened since census data collection on nativity began in 1850. Download a Print-Friendly Version There were 47.8 million immigrants residing in the United States as of 2023, according to the latest American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Census Bureau. Of them, nearly three-quarters were in the country legally as naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents (LPRs, also known as green-card holders), or holders of temporary visas.

More than 47.8 million immigrants lived in the United States in 2023, the most in U.S. history. That year, immigrants comprised 14.3 percent of the U.S. population of 331.9 million, close to the record level of 14.8 percent set in 1890. The immigrant population grew by more than 1.6 million people between 2022 and 2023, or about 3.6 percent, the largest annual growth since at least 2010. How have the number and share of immigrants changed over time? In 1850, the first year the United States began collecting nativity data through the Census, the country had 2.2 million immigrants, representing nearly 10 percent of the U.S. population. Between 1860 and 1920, the immigrant share fluctuated between 13 percent and nearly 15 percent of the population, peaking at 14.8 percent in 1890 amid high levels of immigration from Europe. Restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924 limited permanent immigration almost exclusively to arrivals from Northern and Western Europe. Combined with the Great Depression and onset of World War II, this led to a sharp drop in immigration from the Eastern Hemisphere. Immigration steadily declined through 1970, when 9.6 million immigrants comprised a record-low 4.7 percent of all U.S. residents (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Size and Share of the Immigrant Population in the United States, 1850-2023 Sources : Migration Policy Institute (MPI) tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau 2010-23 American Community Surveys (ACS), and 1970, 1990, and 2000 decennial census; and Campbell J. Gibson and Emily Lennon, \"Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850 to 1990\" (Working Paper no. 29, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 1999). Since 1970, the number of immigrants and their share of the U.S. population has increased rapidly, mainly because of increased immigration from Latin America and Asia. This followed important changes in U.S. immigration law such as enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished national-origin admission quotas, and the creation of a formal refugee resettlement program with the Refugee Act of 1980. Other factors included the growing U.S. economic and military presence in Asia and Latin America, as well as evolving economic and social ties with the United States’ southern neighbors and major economic transformations and political instability in countries around the world.

The 10.9 million U.S. residents born in Mexico represented by far the largest immigrant group in the United States in 2023, although this population declined by about 793,000 since 2010. Mexican immigrants made up 23 percent of the U.S. immigrant population in 2023, down from 29 percent in 2010. India and China (including Hong Kong and Macao but not Taiwan) were the next largest origin countries, accounting for approximately 2.9 million and 2.4 million immigrants, respectively, or 6 percent and 5 percent of all immigrants. Other top countries of origin included the Philippines (4 percent); El Salvador, Cuba, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala (about 3 percent apiece); and Colombia (2 percent). Together, these ten countries accounted for 55 percent of all U.S. immigrants in 2023. Learn more about various immigrant groups with the Migration Information Source ’s U.S. Immigrant Population Spotlights . These data snapshots provide a wealth of information about groups including Mexicans , Indians , Chinese , and Filipinos , as well as more recent populations such as Afghans , Ukrainians , and Venezuelans . How do today’s top countries of origin compare to those of the past? Significant immigration from Latin America and Asia in recent decades represents a sharp turnaround from the mid-1900s, when immigrants came overwhelmingly from Europe. In the 1960s, no single country accounted for more than 15 percent of the U.S. immigrant population; Italians were the top origin group, making up 13 percent of the foreign born in 1960, followed by Germans and Canadians (about 10 percent each). Immigrants from Mexico have comprised the largest group since 1980, but the composition of new arrivals has changed since the 2007-09 recession. By 2013, India and China had displaced Mexico as the top origins for new arrivals. However, amid COVID-19 pandemic-related mobility restrictions and high recent flows, Mexico regained its position as the origin of most new arrivals in 2021. As of 2023, the top origins for immigrants arriving within the last year were Mexico, India, and Cuba. Between 2010 and 2023, the immigrant population from India increased by more than 1.1 million and the population from China rose by 628,000. In contrast, the number of Mexican immigrants declined by almost 793,000, representing the largest absolute decline of any immigrant group during the period. The number of immigrants from Venezuela, Guatemala, Colombia, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Cuba, El Salvador, the Philippines, and Nigeria each increased by at least 250,000 from 2010 to 2023. Among the groups numbering at least 100,000 in 2023, the Venezuelan immigrant population increased the fastest, by 318 percent since 2010, followed by immigrants from Afghanistan (301 percent), Nepal (159 percent), Nigeria and Bangladesh (117 percent each), and Brazil (108 percent). In comparison, the total foreign-born population grew by 20 percent in this period.

Nearly 44 percent of all immigrants in the United States in 2023 arrived prior to 2000. Additionally, 22 percent entered between 2000 and 2009, and 35 percent have come since 2010. What are the largest diaspora groups? Four of the five largest U.S. groups tracing their origin or ancestry to a particular country are European, reflecting a centuries-long history of immigration from Europe. Germany is the largest, with more than 41.1 million U.S. residents, native and foreign born alike, tracing their origin or ancestry there as of 2023. The Mexican-origin diaspora ranked second, with approximately 39.4 million people. The United Kingdom came third, with more than 37.5 million, followed by Ireland with 34.9 million and Italy with 16.2 million. The overwhelming majority of these diaspora groups are people born in the United States. Data tool: Top Diaspora Groups in the United States Do most immigrants have legal status? About 73 percent of immigrants in the United States held permanent legal status (as a naturalized citizen, green-card holder, or refugee or asylee) or a long-term nonimmigrant visa (such as an international student or temporary worker) as of 2023 (see Figure 2).

[1] Since our December 2020 estimate, the illegal alien population in the United States has grown by 4.1 million, or 28.2 percent, reflecting an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration during the Biden administration. The surge in illegal immigration was so large that the U.S. Census Bureau announced just three months ago it has changed its methodology for estimating the foreign-born population to account for it. As of 2025, American population growth comes almost entirely from unsustainably high levels of immigration, both legal and illegal. [2] Illegal Alien Population in U.S. Since 2013 (Millions). Data Source: FAIR Estimates. Chart by FAIR WHO IS AN ILLEGAL ALIEN? An illegal alien is simply any alien who is present in the United States without legal status, like a valid visa or lawful permanent residence. It is important to note that “legal status” is not the same as “lawful presence.” For example, recipients of deferred action, deferred enforced departure, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or parole do not have legal status. These programs (some of which are authorized by statute and some are not) do not give illegal aliens visas or green cards. They merely defer deportation for a period of time. Nevertheless, these aliens are still described as “lawfully present” or as having “lawful presence.” That is because “lawful presence” is a term of art under immigration law designed to clarify that although an alien has no legal status, he or she is not accruing unlawful presence for purposes of the three and ten-year bars under Section 212(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). [3] Pursuant to Section 212(a)(9), an alien who has no legal status will start to accrue days of unlawful presence. If the alien accrues more than 180 days of unlawful presence and is then deported or otherwise leaves, the alien is barred from admission for three years. If the alien accrues 365 or more days (one year) of unlawful presence and is then deported or otherwise leaves, s/he is barred from admission for ten years. [4] However, if an alien is granted a deferral of deportation, such as deferred action, the deferral would not be meaningful if, by staying, the alien could be barred from re-entry for three to ten years. To avoid this outcome, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), now United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), essentially deemed that aliens with such deferrals are “lawfully present” so that they do not accrue days of unlawful presence and are not subject to the statutory bars. [5] For this study’s purposes, we use the definition that conforms to U.S. immigration law and consider individuals present in the U.S. without legal status to be illegal aliens, regardless of any deferments applicable to their removal or accrual of unlawful presence. Counting individuals in these situations as “legal immigrants�� or “lawful residents” would be both incorrect and a biased mischaracterization of immigration law. FAIR offers additional details on who should be considered an illegal alien in our publication titled “Why ‘Illegal Alien’ is the Correct Term.” [6] CHALLENGES ESTIMATING THE ILLEGAL ALIEN POPULATION Estimating the size, distribution, and characteristics of the illegal alien population is an inexact science. The methods used by those claiming to have calculated a definitive figure should be viewed skeptically, as there is no completely reliable source of information on illegal aliens. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only (loosely) counts foreign nationals who enter and leave the United States in a lawful manner, and its illegal alien population estimates remain unhelpful due to underestimating the size of the population and utilizing outdated numbers. [7] In truth, we do not know exactly how many people cross the border illegally and evade immigration authorities, nor can anyone accurately quantify overstays or gotaways. We can only estimate these figures based on annual and monthly census data. Most of the current estimates regarding the total number of illegal aliens are based on U.S. Census Bureau data. Unfortunately, far too many of these tallies presume that essentially all unlawful migrants are willing to respond to demographic questionnaires and that they provide accurate information to federal officials. As their presence in the United States is the result of a violation of law, many illegal aliens understandably see no personal benefit in revealing any information about their nativity or true immigration status. Therefore, when asked about how, when, and why they entered the United States, illegal aliens have a strong motive to either lie, claiming they are lawful immigrants or citizens, or refuse to respond at all. Most reputable demographers and researchers have long understood that there is widespread and systematic undercounting in the Census Bureau’s estimate of the foreign-born population because it is difficult to estimate the portion of that population attributable to illegal immigration. Understandably, many illegal aliens are reluctant to engage with government surveys, and many do not even live in residential addresses within the survey pool. Because of this simple fact, older estimates frequently assumed there was a lower response rate of illegal aliens as a portion of the foreign-born population. Indeed, even before the Biden-era, Census publications frequently acknowledged that certain population groups, particularly sections of the foreign-born, have “undercoverage” rates of 10 to nearly 20 percent. [8] The undercount of the foreign-born population came under greater scrutiny during the Biden-era, when a massive inflow of illegal aliens in just four short years through entirely new channels made it even harder for Census Bureau surveys to capture the true size of the population. The Current Population Survey, for example, is conducted through two 4-month surveys with an 8-month break in between, and only serves a subset of residential addresses. [9] However, many aliens allowed in by the Biden administration lived in migrant shelters, specially designated hotels, homeless shelters, or even on the streets, moving frequently between these. Census surveys were simply not designed with the chaos of places like the infamous Roosevelt Hotel [10] in mind. FAIR and many other organizations recognized a significant disconnect between official immigration data, like border apprehensions, asylum applications and immigration paroles, and the Census Bureau’s lagging and seemingly incomplete estimate of the foreign-born population. With these discrepancies in mind, other organizations began relying on other methods to estimate net illegal immigration for their own purposes. In July 2024, the Congressional Budget Office published a significantly higher estimate than the Census Bureau, estimating net illegal immigration of 9.9 million from 2021-2026 based mostly on DHS data. [11] Financial institutions made their own estimates, with J.P. Morgan noting in early 2025 that undercount among illegal aliens could cause unforeseen pressure on the housing market. [12] News organizations such as The New York Times compared the situation to the 1990s, noting that both then and now undercount becomes much worse when the immigration situation rapidly changes. [13] WHAT HAS CHANGED In December 2024, the Census Bureau admitted that net foreign migration to the U.S. was “significantly higher” than previous estimates. [14] This admission was coupled by significant changes to Census Bureau methodology to capture the sheer scope of the Biden administration’s illegal immigration crisis, which previous survey methods had not accounted for. [15] In particular, the Bureau made significant upward adjustments to its estimate of the foreign-born population to account for the inflows of “humanitarian migrants” that its “Benchmark Database” had captured but the Bureau itself had missed. [16] At the same time, the Census Bureau revised upward its raw estimates of net international migration for the previous three years. From July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, the Census Bureau reported it had missed net foreign migration of roughly 700,000 people, revising its estimate upward by nearly 70 percent, or from 1 million to 1.7 million. From July 1 20222 to June 30, 20203, the Census Bureau revised its estimate upward by an extraordinary 101.7 percent, adding 1.15 million more foreign nationals to its initial estimate of 1.13 million. Finally, from July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024, the Census Bureau estimated that net international migration had reached nearly 2.8 million (a figure higher than the population of Chicago), an unprecedented total. [17] SOURCE: Census Bureau Estimates of Net Foreign Migration, Unadjusted and Adjusted. The chart above, published by the Census Bureau when it announced changes to its methodology, shows the drastic difference between its previous and revised estimates of the foreign-born population. The significant growth in the category of humanitarian migrants between 2021 and 2024 is particularly striking. The Census Bureau’s methodology change validates FAIR’s long-held position that official data, and organizations relying solely on that data, were dramatically undercounting the foreign-born, and thus the illegal alien population. This is because the data in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS) that demographers and other researchers rely on are weighted based on pre-revision Bureau estimates and will undercount the foreign-born to a similarly significant degree unless corrected. Only one year ago, estimates of the foreign-born population based on the CPS showed the that after four years of mass immigration, the foreign-born population stood at a record high (over 50 million). [18] This immigration wave, The New York Times reported, was the largest in American history, surpassing the Ellis Island “Great Wave” era of the late 1890s. [19] At least 60 percent of the foreigners who during this wave were illegal aliens. [20] Now, thanks to the Census Bureau’s revision of its foreign-born population estimates, we know that even this record high was understated by millions. Based on the Census Bureau’s change in methodology, FAIR has revised its methodology to factor in significant undercounting of recent arrivals. Therefore, FAIR’s estimates align much more closely with the Census Bureau’s post-revision figures than other organizations’, though even the revised Bureau data is still subject to normal undercount rates. HOW WE REACHED OUR ESTIMATE To estimate the total number of illegal aliens living in the United States, we began by establishing the total number of native-born and foreign-born residents. This estimate accounts for the Census Bureau’s December 2024 announcement of methodology revisions, unlike virtually every other publicly available estimate. As of the end of 2024, the total U.S. population was 341.1 million in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, several million higher than previously projected, because the foreign-born population had been so significantly undercounted by reporting bodies. We calculated a base estimate of the illegal alien population from that total by eliminating other groups as captured by the most recent ACS and CPS surveys and other publicly available data. After excluding citizens at birth, naturalized citizens, permanent residents, and valid visa holders, we obtained a raw",

(Photo: iStock.com/leekris) Worldwide, the United States is home to more immigrants than any other country, and more than the next four countries—Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and France—combined, according to the most recent UN Population Division data. While the United States represented about 4 percent of the total global population in 2024, 17 percent of all international migrants resided in the United States. The size, though not the share, of the U.S. immigrant population is at a record high. Immigration has been an important contributor to U.S. population growth, which has slowed in the past decade due to falling birth rates. Amid this demographic slowing, immigration accounted for the entire growth of the total U.S. population between 2022 and 2023—the first time this has happened since census data collection on nativity began in 1850. Download a Print-Friendly Version There were 47.8 million immigrants residing in the United States as of 2023, according to the latest American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Census Bureau. Of them, nearly three-quarters were in the country legally as naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents (LPRs, also known as green-card holders), or holders of temporary visas.

More than 47.8 million immigrants lived in the United States in 2023, the most in U.S. history. That year, immigrants comprised 14.3 percent of the U.S. population of 331.9 million, close to the record level of 14.8 percent set in 1890. The immigrant population grew by more than 1.6 million people between 2022 and 2023, or about 3.6 percent, the largest annual growth since at least 2010. How have the number and share of immigrants changed over time? In 1850, the first year the United States began collecting nativity data through the Census, the country had 2.2 million immigrants, representing nearly 10 percent of the U.S. population. Between 1860 and 1920, the immigrant share fluctuated between 13 percent and nearly 15 percent of the population, peaking at 14.8 percent in 1890 amid high levels of immigration from Europe. Restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924 limited permanent immigration almost exclusively to arrivals from Northern and Western Europe. Combined with the Great Depression and onset of World War II, this led to a sharp drop in immigration from the Eastern Hemisphere. Immigration steadily declined through 1970, when 9.6 million immigrants comprised a record-low 4.7 percent of all U.S. residents (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Size and Share of the Immigrant Population in the United States, 1850-2023 Sources : Migration Policy Institute (MPI) tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau 2010-23 American Community Surveys (ACS), and 1970, 1990, and 2000 decennial census; and Campbell J. Gibson and Emily Lennon, \"Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850 to 1990\" (Working Paper no. 29, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 1999). Since 1970, the number of immigrants and their share of the U.S. population has increased rapidly, mainly because of increased immigration from Latin America and Asia. This followed important changes in U.S. immigration law such as enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished national-origin admission quotas, and the creation of a formal refugee resettlement program with the Refugee Act of 1980. Other factors included the growing U.S. economic and military presence in Asia and Latin America, as well as evolving economic and social ties with the United States’ southern neighbors and major economic transformations and political instability in countries around the world.

The 10.9 million U.S. residents born in Mexico represented by far the largest immigrant group in the United States in 2023, although this population declined by about 793,000 since 2010. Mexican immigrants made up 23 percent of the U.S. immigrant population in 2023, down from 29 percent in 2010. India and China (including Hong Kong and Macao but not Taiwan) were the next largest origin countries, accounting for approximately 2.9 million and 2.4 million immigrants, respectively, or 6 percent and 5 percent of all immigrants. Other top countries of origin included the Philippines (4 percent); El Salvador, Cuba, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala (about 3 percent apiece); and Colombia (2 percent). Together, these ten countries accounted for 55 percent of all U.S. immigrants in 2023. Learn more about various immigrant groups with the Migration Information Source ’s U.S. Immigrant Population Spotlights . These data snapshots provide a wealth of information about groups including Mexicans , Indians , Chinese , and Filipinos , as well as more recent populations such as Afghans , Ukrainians , and Venezuelans . How do today’s top countries of origin compare to those of the past? Significant immigration from Latin America and Asia in recent decades represents a sharp turnaround from the mid-1900s, when immigrants came overwhelmingly from Europe. In the 1960s, no single country accounted for more than 15 percent of the U.S. immigrant population; Italians were the top origin group, making up 13 percent of the foreign born in 1960, followed by Germans and Canadians (about 10 percent each). Immigrants from Mexico have comprised the largest group since 1980, but the composition of new arrivals has changed since the 2007-09 recession. By 2013, India and China had displaced Mexico as the top origins for new arrivals. However, amid COVID-19 pandemic-related mobility restrictions and high recent flows, Mexico regained its position as the origin of most new arrivals in 2021. As of 2023, the top origins for immigrants arriving within the last year were Mexico, India, and Cuba. Between 2010 and 2023, the immigrant population from India increased by more than 1.1 million and the population from China rose by 628,000. In contrast, the number of Mexican immigrants declined by almost 793,000, representing the largest absolute decline of any immigrant group during the period. The number of immigrants from Venezuela, Guatemala, Colombia, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Cuba, El Salvador, the Philippines, and Nigeria each increased by at least 250,000 from 2010 to 2023. Among the groups numbering at least 100,000 in 2023, the Venezuelan immigrant population increased the fastest, by 318 percent since 2010, followed by immigrants from Afghanistan (301 percent), Nepal (159 percent), Nigeria and Bangladesh (117 percent each), and Brazil (108 percent). In comparison, the total foreign-born population grew by 20 percent in this period.

Nearly 44 percent of all immigrants in the United States in 2023 arrived prior to 2000. Additionally, 22 percent entered between 2000 and 2009, and 35 percent have come since 2010. What are the largest diaspora groups? Four of the five largest U.S. groups tracing their origin or ancestry to a particular country are European, reflecting a centuries-long history of immigration from Europe. Germany is the largest, with more than 41.1 million U.S. residents, native and foreign born alike, tracing their origin or ancestry there as of 2023. The Mexican-origin diaspora ranked second, with approximately 39.4 million people. The United Kingdom came third, with more than 37.5 million, followed by Ireland with 34.9 million and Italy with 16.2 million. The overwhelming majority of these diaspora groups are people born in the United States. Data tool: Top Diaspora Groups in the United States Do most immigrants have legal status? About 73 percent of immigrants in the United States held permanent legal status (as a naturalized citizen, green-card holder, or refugee or asylee) or a long-term nonimmigrant visa (such as an international student or temporary worker) as of 2023 (see Figure 2).

    "claim_container": "Immigration has been a major source of population growth and cultural change in the United States throughout much of its history. As of January 2025, the United States has the largest immigrant population in the world in absolute terms, with 53.3 million foreign-born residents, representing 15.8% of the total U.S. population—both record highs.[1] While the United States represented about 4% of the total global population in 2024, 17% of all international migrants resided in the United States.[2] In March 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated that approximately 18.6 million illegal immigrants resided in the United States.[3] In 2024, immigrants and their U.S.-born children number more than 93 million people, or 28% of the total U.S. population.[2] According to the 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States admitted a total of 1.18 million legal immigrants (618k new arrivals, 565k status adjustments) in 2016.[4] Of these, 48% were the immediate relatives of United States citizens, 20% were family-sponsored, 13% were refugees or asylum seekers, 12% were employment-based preferences, 4.2% were part of the Diversity Immigrant Visa program, 1.4% were victims of a crime (U1) or their family members were (U2 to U5),[5] and 1.0% who were granted the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for Iraqis and Afghans employed by the United States Government.[4] The remaining 0.4% included small numbers from several other categories, including 0.2% who were granted suspension of deportation as an immediate relative of a citizen (Z13);[6] persons admitted under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act; children born after the issuance of a parent's visa; and certain parolees from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who were denied refugee status.[4]",

As of January 2025, the United States has the largest immigrant population in the world in absolute terms, with 53.3 million foreign-born residents, representing 15.8% of the total U.S. population—both record highs.[1] While the United States represented about 4% of the total global population in 2024, 17% of all international migrants resided in the United States.[2] In March 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated that approximately 18.6 million illegal immigrants resided in the United States.[3] In 2024, immigrants and their U.S.-born children number more than 93 million people, or 28% of the total U.S. population.[2] According to the 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States admitted a total of 1.18 million legal immigrants (618k new arrivals, 565k status adjustments) in 2016.[4] Of these, 48% were the immediate relatives of United States citizens, 20% were family-sponsored, 13% were refugees or asylum seekers, 12% were employment-based preferences, 4.2% were part of the Diversity Immigrant Visa program, 1.4% were victims of a crime (U1) or their family members were (U2 to U5),[5] and 1.0% who were granted the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for Iraqis and Afghans employed by the United States Government.[4] The remaining 0.4% included small numbers from several other categories, including 0.2% who were granted suspension of deportation as an immediate relative of a citizen (Z13);[6] persons admitted under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act; children born after the issuance of a parent's visa; and certain parolees from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who were denied refugee status.[4]",

The limits are calculated each fiscal year depending on the total number of family-sponsored and employment-based visas available. No more than 7 percent of the visas may be issued to natives of any one independent country in a fiscal year; no more than 2 percent may issued to any one dependency of any independent country. The per-country limit does not indicate, however, that a country is entitled to the maximum number of visas each year, just that it cannot receive more than that number. Because of the combined workings of the preference system and per-country limits, most countries do not reach this level of visa issuance.

Camarota Monthly Census Bureau Data Shows Big Increase in Foreign-Born Monthly Census Bureau Data Shows Big Increase in Foreign-Born Immigrant population (legal and illegal) grew 1.6 million in past year By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler on November 2, 2021 An analysis of the Census Bureau monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that after falling for much of 2020, the foreign-born population (legal and illegal), has rebounded dramatically, increasing by 1.6 million between September 2020 and September 2021, which is the most recent data available. Unlike arrival figures for legal immigrants or border apprehension numbers, the CPS provides insight into the number of foreign-born people, also referred to as immigrants, who have actually settled in the United States, reflecting both new arrivals and those who leave or die each year. There is a lot of variation from month to month in the CPS, so any change should be interpreted in light of this variability. But the data shows clear evidence first of a decline in the total immigrant population (legal and illegal) due to Covid-19 restrictions, and then a dramatic increase reflecting the surge of illegal immigration at the southern border, the restarting of visa processing at American consulates overseas, and the return of international travelers more generally in recent months. Growth in the Immigrant Population. While there is some undercount, particularly of illegal immigrants, the foreign-born in Census Bureau surveys includes all persons who were not U.S. citizens at birth — naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, long-term temporary visitors (e.g. guestworkers and foreign students) and illegal immigrants. Growth in the total immigrant population can only be caused by new legal and illegal immigrants arriving from abroad. Births to immigrants in the United States do not add to the foreign-born as all persons born in the United States are considered native-born by definition. New immigration is offset by those immigrants who leave the country each year ( previously estimated at nearly one million annually) and natural mortality among the existing immigrant population of roughly 300,000 a year. For the immigrant population to grow, new arrivals must exceed return migration and deaths. Figure 1 shows the total immigrant population (legal and illegal) from January 2010 to September 2021, along with margins of error. Figure 1 shows that the nation’s immigrant population grew to 45.4 million in September 2021, a 1.6 million increase since September 2020. The recent growth of 1.6 million follows a 1.1 one million decline in the total immigrant population between September 2019 and September 2020. The decline almost certainly reflects the significant reduction in new legal and illegal immigration due to Covid-19 restrictions on international travel, the suspension, for a time, of visa processing at American consulates overseas, and Title 42 expulsions , which allowed the U.S. government to send illegal immigrants apprehended at the border immediately back to Mexico, even if the immigrant was not from that country. All of these factors seem to have significantly slowed the pace of new arrivals into the country. At the same time, some level of outmigration continued during this time period as did natural mortality, causing the total immigrant population to fall through the middle of 2020. Figure 2 shows a year-to-year monthly comparison in the size of the immigrant population. The biggest year-to-year monthly decline was the 1.6 million from March 2019 to March 2020. But the immigrant population fell to its smallest size of 43.8 million in August 2020. (Click here for a larger version of Figure 1.) (Click here for a larger version of Figure 2.) Illegal Immigration. The federal government , as well as outside researchers , have previously estimated that nearly three-quarters of illegal immigrants are Hispanic, so the recent increase in Hispanic immigrants can be seen as an indication that illegal immigration has increased dramatically in the last year. Hispanic immigrants (legal and illegal), accounted for about half of the 1.6 million increase since last September. Figure 3 shows the number of Hispanic immigrants living in the country and Figure 4 shows year-to-year monthly changes in that population. Like the overall foreign-born population, Figures 3 and 4 show that the number of Hispanic immigrants fell dramatically at the high of the Covid-19 epidemic before rebounding dramatically at the end of 2020 and into 2021. This strongly suggests that the dramatic surge in illegal immigration at the southern border since President Biden’s election is showing up, at least in part, in the monthly Current Population Survey. (Click here for a larger version of Figure 3.) (Click here for a larger version of Figure 4.) The Trump Effect. The monthly data also show evidence for a “Trump effect” on immigration — legal and illegal. Our prior analysis of other Census Bureau data shows that during his first three years in office, before Covid-19 hit, growth in the legal and illegal immigrant population slowed, reflecting a decline in new arrivals and a substantial increase in out-migration. The monthly data confirms our prior findings. In his four years in office (January 2017 to January 2021), the foreign-born population grew by 1.6 million, less than half the 3.4 million growth during Obama’s second term (January 2013 to January 2017). Of course, immigration in the last year of the Trump administration was impacted by the Covid-19 epidemic. But looking only at the first three years (January 2017 to January 2020) of Trump’s administration, before Covid, shows the immigrant population grew by one million, compared to three million in the first three years of the second Obama administration (January 2013 to January 2016). About the Data. It must be remembered that the monthly CPS, while a large sample , still has a relatively large numerical margin of error of roughly ±500,000 for the foreign-born, assuming a 90 percent confidence level. So numerical fluctuations from month to month can be quite large, making it necessary to compare large changes over longer periods of time when drawing conclusions about trends. The margins of error shown in Figures 1 and 3 are based on standard errors calculated using parameter estimates , which reflect the survey’s complex design. Neither the BLS or the Census Bureau has provided parameter estimates for the general population for the monthly CPS, so we use those for the labor force. It should also be noted that, like virtually all modern surveys, the CPS is weighted to reflect the total population by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin. Each January the weights used in the CPS, also called population controls, are re-adjusted to reflect updated figures on births, deaths, and net international migration. The update in January 2021 adjusted the size of the U.S. population slightly downward for January 2021 from December 2020, including the number of Hispanics and Asians. This should have reduced growth in the foreign-born slightly. Yet, the CPS still shows growth in the number of immigrants after this adjustment. Potential Problems with the CPS. The Census Bureau collects the monthly CPS for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS reports potential problems with the CPS since March 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. First, interviewers who administered the survey miscoded some respondents as employed when they were on furlough, temporary layoff, or similar situations. More importantly for the purposes of this analysis, BLS also states that response rates from March 2020 through September 2021 for the CPS were lower than prior to Covid-19, though rates have improved since hitting a low in June 2020. These lower rates increase the sampling error of the survey. It is not known if this problem had any impact on estimates of the foreign-born in the data. However, in June 2020, when the problem was most pronounced, BLS stated that “Although the response rate was adversely affected by pandemic-related issues, BLS was still able to obtain estimates that met our standards for accuracy and reliability.” The Other Large Census Bureau Survey. The Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey (ACS), which also identifies immigrants, is much larger than the CPS and is often used to study the foreign-born. Its larger size means that it has smaller margins of error than the CPS. But the ACS only provides annual estimates, and data from the ACS is released much more slowly than data from the CPS. The 2020 ACS has not yet been released. Moreover, the ACS reflects the U.S. population in July of each year, so when the 2020 ACS is released, it should show a decline in the foreign-born between 2019 and 2020, as in the CPS. But the 2020 ACS will not reflect the rebound after July 2020.

(Mark Ralson/AFP/Getty Images) The United States has more immigrants than any other country in the world . Today, more than 40 million people living in the U.S. were born in another country, accounting for about one-fifth of the world’s migrants in 2017. The population of immigrants is also very diverse, with just about every country in the world represented among U.S. immigrants. View interactive charts and detailed tables on U.S. immigrants. Pew Research Center regularly publishes statistical portraits of the nation’s foreign-born population, which include historical trends since 1960 . Based on these portraits, here are answers to some key questions about the U.S. immigrant population. How many people in the U.S. are immigrants? The U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 44.4 million in 2017. Since 1965, when U.S. immigration laws replaced a national quota system , the number of immigrants living in the U.S. has more than quadrupled. Immigrants today account for 13.6% of the U.S. population, nearly triple the share (4.7%) in 1970. However, today’s immigrant share remains below the record 14.8% share in 1890, when 9.2 million immigrants lived in the U.S. What is the legal status of immigrants in the U.S.? Most immigrants (77%) are in the country legally, while almost a quarter are unauthorized, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on census data adjusted for undercount . In 2017, 45% were naturalized U.S. citizens. Some 27% of immigrants were permanent residents and 5% were temporary residents in 2017. Another 23% of all immigrants were unauthorized immigrants. From 1990 to 2007, the unauthorized immigrant population more than tripled in size – from 3.5 million to a record high of 12.2 million in 2007. By 2017, that number had declined by 1.7 million, or 14%. There were 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2017, accounting for 3.2% of the nation’s population. The decline in the unauthorized immigrant population is due largely to a fall in the number from Mexico – the single largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2017, this group decreased by 2 million. Meanwhile, there was a rise in the number from Central America and Asia . Do all lawful immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens? Try our email course on immigration Learn about U.S. immigration through five short lessons delivered to your inbox every other day. Sign up now! Not all lawful permanent residents choose to pursue U.S. citizenship. Those who wish to do so may apply after meeting certain requirements , including having lived in the U.S. for five years. In fiscal year 2018, about 800,000 immigrants applied for naturalization. The number of naturalization applications has climbed in recent years, though the annual totals remain below the 1.4 million applications filed in 2007. Generally, most immigrants eligible for naturalization apply to become citizens. However, Mexican lawful immigrants have the lowest naturalization rate overall. Language and personal barriers, lack of interest and financial barriers are among the top reasons for choosing not to naturalize cited by Mexican-born green card holders, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey . Where do immigrants come from? Mexico is the top origin country of the U.S. immigrant population. In 2017, 11.2 million immigrants living in the U.S. were from there, accounting for 25% of all U.S. immigrants. The next largest origin groups were those from China (6%), India (6%), the Philippines (5%) and El Salvador (3%). By region of birth , immigrants from South and East Asia combined accounted for 27% of all immigrants, close to the share of immigrants from Mexico (25%). Other regions make up smaller shares: Europe/Canada (13%), the Caribbean (10%), Central America (8%), South America (7%), the Middle East (4%) and sub-Saharan Africa (4%). Who is arriving today? More than 1 million immigrants arrive in the U.S. each year. In 2017, the top country of origin for new immigrants coming into the U.S. was India, with 126,000 people, followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000). By race and ethnicity , more Asian immigrants than Hispanic immigrants have arrived in the U.S. in most years since 2010. Immigration from Latin America slowed following the Great Recession, particularly for Mexico, which has seen both decreasing flows into the United States and large flows back to Mexico in recent years. Asians are projected to become the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by 2055, surpassing Hispanics. Pew Research Center estimates indicate that in 2065, Asians will make up some 38% of all immigrants; Hispanics, 31%; whites, 20%; and blacks, 9%. Is the immigrant population growing? New immigrant arrivals have fallen, mainly due to a decrease in the number of unauthorized immigrants coming to the U.S. The drop in the unauthorized immigrant population can primarily be attributed to more Mexican immigrants leaving the U.S. than coming in . Looking forward, immigrants and their descendants are projected to account for 88% of U.S. population growth through 2065 , assuming current immigration trends continue. In addition to new arrivals, U.S. births to immigrant parents will be important to future growth in the country’s population. In 2017, the percentage of women giving birth in the past year was higher among immigrants (7.5%) than among the U.S. born (5.8%). While U.S.-born women gave birth to more than 3 million children that year, immigrant women gave birth to about 780,000. How many immigrants have come to the U.S. as refugees? Since the creation of the federal Refugee Resettlement Program in 1980, about 3 million refugees have been resettled in the U.S – more than any other country. In fiscal 2018, a total of 22,491 refugees were resettled in the U.S. The largest origin group of refugees was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by Burma (Myanmar), Ukraine, Bhutan and Eritrea. Among all refugees admitted in that fiscal year, 3,495 are Muslims (16%) and 16,018 are Christians (71%). Texas, Washington, Ohio and California resettled more than a quarter of all refugees admitted in fiscal 2018. Where do most U.S. immigrants live? Roughly half (45%) of the nation’s 44.4 million immigrants live in just three states: California (24%), Texas (11%) and New York (10%) . California had the largest immigrant population of any state in 2017, at 10.6 million. Texas and New York had more than 4.5 million immigrants each. In terms of regions , about two-thirds of immigrants lived in the West (34%) and South (33%). Roughly one-fifth lived in the Northeast (21%) and 11% were in the Midwest. In 2017, most immigrants lived in just 20 major metropolitan areas, with the largest populations in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. These top 20 metro areas were home to 28.7 million immigrants, or 65% of the nation’s total. Most of the nation’s unauthorized immigrant population lived in these top metro areas as well. How do immigrants compare with the U.S. population overall in education? Immigrants in the U.S. as a whole have lower levels of education than the U.S.-born population. In 2017, immigrants were three times as likely as the U.S. born to have not completed high school (27% vs. 9%). However, immigrants were just as likely as the U.S. born to have a bachelor’s degree or more (31% and 32%, respectively). Educational attainment varies among the nation’s immigrant groups, particularly across immigrants from different regions of the world. Immigrants from Mexico and Central America are less likely to be high school graduates than the U.S. born (54% and 46%, respectively, do not have a high school diploma, vs. 9% of U.S. born). On the other hand, immigrants from South and East Asia, Europe/Canada, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa were more likely than U.S.-born residents to have a bachelor’s or advanced degree. Among all immigrants, those from South and East Asia (53%) and the Middle East (48%) were the most likely to have a bachelor’s degree or more. Immigrants from Mexico (7%) and Central America (11%) were the least likely to have a bachelor’s or higher. How many immigrants are working in the U.S.? In 2017, about 29 million immigrants were working or looking for work in the U.S., making up some 17% of the total civilian labor force. Lawful immigrants made up the majority of the immigrant workforce, at 21.2 million. An additional 7.6 million immigrant workers are unauthorized immigrants , less than the total of the previous year and notably less than in 2007, when they were 8.2 million. They alone account for 4.6% of the civilian labor force, a dip from their peak of 5.4% in 2007. During the same period, the overall U.S. workforce grew, as did the number of U.S.-born workers and lawful immigrant workers. Immigrants are also projected to drive future growth in the U.S. working-age population through at least 2035. As the Baby Boom generation heads into retirement, immigrants and their children are expected to offset a decline in the working-age population by adding about 18 million people of working age between 2015 and 2035. How well do immigrants speak English? Among immigrants ages 5 and older, half (52%) are proficient English speakers – either speaking English very well (36%) or only speaking English at home (16%). Immigrants from Mexico have the lowest rates of English proficiency (33%), followed by Central Americans (34%), South Americans (54%) and immigrants from South and East Asia (56%). Those from Europe or Canada (77%), sub-Saharan Africa (73%) and the Middle East (61%) have the highest rates of English proficiency. The longer immigrants have lived in the U.S. , the greater the likelihood they are English proficient. Some 45% of immigrants living in the U.S. five years or less are proficient. By contrast, more than half (56%) of immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for 20 years or more are proficient English speakers. Among immigrants ages 5 and older, Spanish is the most commonly spoken language . Some 43% of immigrants in the U.S. speak Spanish at home. The top five languages spoken at home among immigrants outside of Spanish are English only (17%), followed by Chinese (6%), Hindi (5%), Filipino/Tagalog (4%) and French (3%). How many immigrants have been deported recently? Around 295,000 immigrants were deported from the U.S. in fiscal 2017 , down since 2016. Overall, the Obama administration deported about 3 million immigrants between 2009 and 2016, a significantly higher number than the 2 million immigrants deported by the Bush administration between 2001 and 2008. In 2017, the Trump administration deported 295,000 immigrants, the lowest total since 2006. Immigrants convicted of a crime made up the minority of deportations in 2017, the most recent year for which statistics by criminal status are available. Of the 295,000 immigrants deported in 2017, some 41% had criminal convictions and 59% were not convicted of a crime. From 2001 to 2017, a maj",

(Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images) The United States plans to admit a maximum of 18,000 refugees in fiscal year 2020, down from a cap of 30,000 in the one that ended Sept. 30, 2019, under a new refugee admissions ceiling set by the Trump administration. This would be the lowest number of refugees resettled by the U.S. in a single year since 1980, when Congress created the nation’s refugee resettlement program. Even before the administration’s announcement, refugee resettlement in the U.S. had dropped to historic lows during Donald Trump’s presidency, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of State Department data . As a result, the U.S. is no longer the world’s top country for refugee admissions. It had previously led the world on this measure for decades, admitting more refugees each year than all other countries combined. The decline in U.S. refugee admissions comes at a time when the number of refugees worldwide has reached the highest levels since World War II. Here are key facts from our research about refugees entering the United States: The refugee approval process for resettlement in the United States can take several months or years while security checks and other screenings are completed. Refugee applicants are referred to U.S. officials by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , U.S. embassies and nongovernmental organizations. Resettlement candidates first apply for refugee status while in another country and do not enter the U.S. until they have legal permission to do so. (Asylum seekers, by contrast, are people who migrate and cross a border without first having received legal permission to enter their destination country.) While awaiting resettlement, refugees undergo health screenings and cultural orientations before entering the U.S. The International Organization for Migration and U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement work with U.S.-based voluntary agencies such as the International Rescue Committee or Church World Service to resettle refugees within the United States. With offices across the nation, these agencies help resettle refugees across many states. Once resettled, refugees learn English and acquire job skills with help from local nonprofits like ethnic associations and church-based groups. After several months, financial assistance from federal agencies stops and refugees are expected to become financially self-sufficient. Most refugee households have someone who finds employment shortly after resettlement. U.S. refugees are granted permanent residency within a year of arrival and can apply for U.S. citizenship five years later. 1 Refugee admissions into the U.S. have declined substantially during Donald Trump’s presidency. Every fall, the U.S. president sets a refugee ceiling – the maximum number of refugees who may enter the country in a fiscal year. In fiscal 2017 (Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017), about 53,700 refugees resettled in the U.S. – a figure that reflects a temporary freeze on refugee admissions that Trump ordered shortly after taking office. The following year, Trump’s first full fiscal year in office, he set the nation’s refugee ceiling at 45,000, a new low at the time, and the U.S. ultimately admitted about 22,500. Trump then set the refugee ceiling at 30,000 for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2019, and refugee admissions reached this cap. For fiscal 2020, which started Oct. 1, 2019, Trump has set a ceiling of 18,000 refugees. Overall, the U.S. has admitted about 76,200 refugees so far under the Trump administration (Jan. 20, 2017, to Sept. 30, 2019). By comparison, the U.S. admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in fiscal 2016 alone, the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration. 2 Historically, the total number of refugees coming to the U.S. has fluctuated with global events and U.S. priorities. From fiscal years 1990 to 1995, an average of about 116,000 refugees arrived in the U.S. each year, with many coming from the former Soviet Union. However, refugee admissions dropped off to roughly 27,100 in fiscal 2002, a new low at the time, after the U.S. largely suspended admissions following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Refugee admissions rebounded from this low point. From fiscal 2008 to 2017, an average of about 67,100 refugees arrived each year. Half or more of refugees during this time came from Asia, with many from Iraq and Burma (Myanmar). (Iraq is counted as a part of Asia in this data source.) Since fiscal 1980, 55% of refugees have come from Asia, a far higher share than from Europe (28%), Africa (13%) or Latin America (4%). 3 Refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo far outnumbered those from other countries in fiscal 2019. D.R. Congo accounted for nearly 13,000 refugees, followed by Burma (Myanmar) with about 4,900, then Ukraine (4,500), Eritrea (1,800) and Afghanistan (1,200). The picture looks different over the longer term. Since fiscal 2002 (Oct. 1, 2001, to Sept. 30, 2019), the most refugees have come from Burma (about 177,700), Iraq (144,400) and Somalia (104,100). 4 The U.S. has admitted far more Christian refugees than Muslim refugees in recent years. Christians accounted for 79% of refugees who came to the U.S. in fiscal 2019. The U.S. admitted about 23,800 Christians, compared with about 4,900 Muslims and smaller numbers of other religious groups. This pattern marks a sharp reversal from several years ago. In fiscal 2016, the number of Muslim refugees admitted reached 38,900, a historic high that narrowly outpaced Christian refugee admissions (about 37,500). That year, Muslims accounted for 46% of the year’s refugees, the highest share since fiscal 2006. Since fiscal 2002 (Oct. 1, 2001, to Sept. 30, 2019), the U.S. has admitted about 464,700 Christian refugees and about 310,700 Muslim refugees. 5 Texas, Washington, New York and California resettled roughly a quarter of all refugees in fiscal 2019. Together, these states took in nearly 8,100 refugees. Other states that received at least 1,000 refugees include Kentucky, Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia and Michigan. By contrast, the District of Columbia, Delaware and West Virginia each resettled fewer than 10 refugees. Hawaii and Wyoming took in no refugees in fiscal 2019. Since fiscal 2002, California has resettled the most refugees (about 108,600), followed by Texas (88,300), New York (58,500) and Florida (48,700). 6 Americans have been divided in recent years over whether the U.S. should accept refugees, with large differences by political party affiliation. In a May 2018 survey, for example, about half of Americans (51%) said the U.S. has a responsibility to accept refugees into the country, while 43% said it does not. Around three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (74%) said the U.S. has this responsibility, compared with 26% of Republicans and Republican leaners. For much of the 20th century, U.S. public opinion polls showed fairly consistent disapproval of admitting large numbers of foreigners fleeing war and oppression, regardless of official government policy.

Why did a little Guatemalan girl die after crossing the US border? Read more The forces driving ordinary people to leave their homes and put their lives at risk crossing deserts with smugglers to get to the US border are deeply rooted in Central America’s history of inequality and violence, in which the US has long played a defining role. The flow of migrants trying to cross the border illegally is not all blowback from US foreign policy. Much of the poverty, injustice and murder in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is homegrown, harking back to the age of Spanish conquest. Small criminal elites have long prospered at the expense of the populations . Experts on the region argue, however, that when politicians or activists have come forward on behalf of its dispossessed, the US has consistently intervened on the side of the powerful and wealthy to help crush them, or looked the other way when they have been slaughtered. The families in the migrant caravans trudging towards the US border are trying to escape a hell that the US has helped to create. View image in fullscreen Central America’s inequality and violence, in which the US has long played a role, is driving people to leave their homes. Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/Reuters Sometimes it has been a matter of unintended consequences. Enforcement measures targeting migrants have multiplied the cost of smugglers’ services. Desperate customers take out big loans at high interest in order to pay. The only hope of paying off those loans is to reach the US, so even if they fail at their quest, they have no choice but to try again, and again. “Where it used to cost around $1,000 to make the journey from Central America, it now costs up to $12,000, making shuttle migration impossible,” said Elizabeth Oglesby, an associate professor at the centre for Latin American studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “The only way for families to stay together is for women and children to migrate.” More often US intervention in the affairs of these small and weak states has been deliberate, motivated by profit or ideology or both. “The destabilisation in the 1980s – which was very much part of the US cold war effort – was incredibly important in creating the kind of political and economic conditions that exist in those countries today,” said Christy Thornton, a sociologist focused on Latin America at Johns Hopkins University. Guatemala Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquín, who died of septic shock and cardiac arrest in US border patrol custody, came from Alta Verapaz, in the northern Guatemala highlands, where small-scale farmers are being driven off their land to make way for agro-industry producing sugar and biofuels. Desperation drives American dream in Guatemalan town of lost opportunity Read more It is an example of why it is often hard to distinguish between security and economic reasons for migration. The men behind the land grabs are often active or retired military officers, who are deeply involved in organised crime. “When communities fight back against land-grabbing, their leaders can be killed. We’ve seen just in the past year almost two dozen community leaders assassinated,” Oglesby said. “There is a legacy of impunity.” Guatemala’s long civil war can in turn be traced back to a 1954 coup against a democratically elected president, Jacobo Árbenz, which was backed by the US. Washington backed the Guatemalan military, which was responsible for genocide against the native population . An estimated 200,000 people were killed between 1960 and 1996.

Photograph: Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images “The point was to root out anything that looked like communist subversion, but it was really a scorched earth policy against the indigenous people,” Thornton said. Central America&#x27;s rampant violence fuels an invisible refugee crisis Read more The issue of impunity for violence remains central to Guatemala’s chronic problems. Jimmy Morales, a former comedian and the country’s president since 2016, has announced he is going to close down the UN-backed International Committee against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig). Cicig has investigated corruption cases against Morales, his family and his political patrons, and links between organised crime and politicians like himself. In September Cicig headquarters were surrounded by US-donated military jeeps, but there was no complaint from the Trump White House. On Tuesday, the government announced it was withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 11 Cicig workers. El Salvador El Salvador is also trapped in a cycle of violence that can be traced back to a civil conflict in which the US was a protagonist, training and funding rightwing death squads in the name of fighting communism. “The civil war really destroyed the economic base of the country and any sense of a functioning democracy,” said Thornton. “It left a massively militarised society.” Gangs have filled much of the space occupied by civil society in healthier societies, but they too are largely a US import. The MS-13 gang, frequently referred to by Donald Trump in justification of his hardline immigration policies, was formed in Los Angeles, and introduced into El Salvador when its members were deported – often to a country they barely knew: another instance of unintended consequences which have rubbed salt in the Central America’s wounds. Honduras When Manuel Zelaya, Honduras’s reformist president, was seized by the country’s military in 2009, and flown out of the country to Costa Rica, still in his pyjamas, the Obama administration refused to call it a coup . Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state at the time, argued that to do so would have meant cutting aid at the expense of the Honduran poor. In the first edition of her memoir, Hard Choices, she admitted working with other Latin American governments to ensure Zelaya would not return to power . The references to her role were removed in later editions. View image in fullscreen Manuel Zelaya is overcome by teargas during a protest against the re-election of Honduras’s President Juan Orlando Hernández in Tegucigalpa in January 2018. Photograph: Jorge Cabrera/Reuters Zelaya had been trying to resolve conflicts over land, that pitted local campesinos against agro-industry. After the coup, that conflict was militarised and more than a hundred campesinos were murdered. Organised crime spread through the country’s institutions and the murder rate soared. Within a year, Honduras was the most violent country in the world not actually at war. What is forcing thousands of migrants to flee their home countries? | Michael Deibert Read more The current president, Juan Orlando Hernández, has further militarised the police force. When he looked in danger of losing his re-election bid last year, he unleashed a wave of violence against the opposition and extinguished the challenge. The Trump administration congratulated him on his victory. “These societies were poor and violent irrespective of when the United States became involved in a major way,” Cynthia Arnson, the director of the Latin American Programme at the Wilson Centre thinktank, said. But she added: “The US since the very early stages of the cold war has played a defining role in the evolution of state violence.” Explore more on these topics US foreign policy US immigration Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Americas explainers Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US news Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development",

As his price for not deporting roughly 800,000 “Dreamers” who came to this country as children, Donald Trump demands an escalated war against immigrants, topped by his nightmarish 2,000-mile wall along the Mexican border. Democrats have said no. Whether or not some sort of deal is eventually struck, the country will remain deeply divided over undocumented immigrants from the south. Ad Policy Unfortunately, though, that debate is entirely focused on domestic policy—how to treat the undocumented after they have arrived. Democrats, thinking Latinos will vote for them, want the newcomers to stay. Republicans, fearing Democrats are right, want them sent back. Employers want their cheap labor. Workers fear their wage competition. The clash of these agendas further inflames simmering social tensions over racism, police tactics, and cultural identity, which in turn feed Trump’s reactionary base. Lost in these US-centric arguments is the role of our foreign policy in creating the conditions that push people in Central America and Mexico to make the long, arduous, and frequently fatal trek north. In the 1980s, Washington and its neoliberal collaborators began imposing policies that favored multinational corporations and hurt the working poor. For at least 150 years, the United States has intervened with arms, political pressure, and foreign aid in order to protect the business and military elites of these countries who have prospered by impoverishing their people. Related Article How US Policies Fueled Mexico&#8217;s Great Migration David Bacon Still, illegal immigration from the region remained modest until the 1980s, when the US government and its neoliberal collaborators at the IMF and World Bank began imposing policies on the region that favored large multinational corporations, undercutting the small farms and businesses that had supported the working poor. Meanwhile, many of the oligarchs became partners in the growing narco-trafficking business. Protected by government officials, criminal gangs have spread throughout the region, adding threats of kidnapping, extortion, rape, and murder to the daily life of people struggling to make a living. A young Guatemalan recently told me: “Unless you are connected to one of the families that run this country, there is no future here. Either you work for the narcos or go north.” The War on Drugs has given weapons and political protection to oligarchs. The US response has been a War on Drugs that provides these same oligarchs with political protection and more weapons. In 2009, for example, the Obama administration ensured the success of a coup by the Honduran military against an elected president whose modest social programs of food and education for the poor had enraged the ruling class. Current Issue View our current issue Since then, US aid to the Honduran oligarchs has more than doubled. Yet two-thirds of Hondurans live in poverty. Large numbers inhabit shacks without toilets, and can’t afford to buy shoes for their children. And the murder rate among Latin American countries is second only to that of El Salvador, which has received even more US aid. Five years after the Honduran coup, the number of children illegally crossing into the United States increased by 1,272 percent. The ruling class in Mexico, despite that country’s greater size and nationalist culture, has a similar relationship with us—to similar effect. The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, sold to Congress as a way to keep Mexicans home, threw millions of peasants and small businesses out of work. Illegal immigration from Mexico doubled. Over the past 10 years, the United States has given Mexico $2 billion in technology and training, ostensibly to fight drug cartels. Yet, as an international coalition of human-rights groups reported in August, the documented cases of government-connected assassination, torture, and disappearances of activists, journalists, and ordinary people keep piling up. True, higher fences and more dogs and drones have reduced the rate of illegal crossings. As has a reign of terror against the undocumented—midnight raids, mass deportations, and the ripping apart of families. But that has not stopped the drugs, and it will not stop people from fleeing for their lives. A recent poll reports that one-third of Mexicans (43 million people) would come to the United States if they could. Even if Trump builds his wall, they will find a way over, around, or under it. We have trapped Latin American migrants between a foreign policy that drives them from home and a domestic policy that drives them back. A humane deal concerning the fate of the Dreamers, although unlikely, would be welcome. But the fundamental conflicts that poison our politics over this issue will remain. If we are ever finally going to resolve how we deal with them here we need to change what we are doing to them there .

Rockefeller Jr. Librar The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (Images From Adapting to a New World: English Society in the Seventeenth Century Chesapeake by James Horn. Copyright &#169; 1994 by the University of North Carolina Press. Used by permission of the publisher. www.uncpress.unc.edu ) During the seventeenth century, emergent societies of the English Atlantic were transformed by large-scale migrations of hundreds of thousands of white settlers. Most ended up in colonies that produced the major staples of colonial trade, tobacco and sugar: approximately 210,000 went to the Caribbean, 130,000 to the Chesapeake (Virginia and Maryland), 24,000 to the Middle Colonies, and 21,000 to New England. Figure 1: Destinations and Annual Totals of Servants Emigrating from Bristol to America, 1654-1680. The peak period of English emigration occurred within a single generation, from 1630 to 1660, but the rapid growth of the tobacco industry created a continual demand for cheap labor in Virginia and Maryland. In the 1630s and 1640s, white immigration averaged about 8,000-9,000 per decade, surged to 16,000-20,000 per decade from 1650 to 1680, before falling back to 13,000-14,000 in the 1680s and 1690s. Servitude was a defining characteristic of settler society in the Chesapeake. A far larger proportion of the population was committed to contractual labor than in England, and indentured servants (not enslaved Africans) would comprise the main source of labor in the tobacco fields during the entire century. (1) Early Virginia was an immigrant society, highly sensitive to the social composition of new arrivals and closely attuned to the sweeping changes taking place in England. This is not the place to examine such changes in detail, but a number had a direct bearing on English colonizing projects and on the experience of servants before embarking for America. Of major significance, since so much stemmed from it, was the doubling of England's population from 2.3 to 4.8 million in little more than a century between 1520 and 1630. This huge increase had serious and far-reaching consequences. Rising prices and declining real wages led to a disastrous drop in the living standards of the poorer sections of society, while sporadic harvest failures and food shortages brought widespread misery throughout many parts of southern and central England. Poverty was reflected by the rapid rise in the numbers of poor in town and country alike, the spreading slums of cities, spiraling mortality rates, the massive increase in vagrancy, and the steady tramp of the young and out of work from one part of the country to another in search of subsistence. By the early seventeenth century, the third world of the poor had risen dramatically in some regions, particularly in woodlands and forests, manufacturing districts, and the country's burgeoning towns, cities, and ports, where as much as half the population lived on or below the poverty line. (2) For many poor, taking ship to the plantations was a spectacular form of subsistence migration, necessitated by the difficulties of earning a living and the lack of any immediate prospect of conditions getting better. Across the century, about three-quarters of all English settlers arrived in Virginia as indentured servants and served usually four to five years in return for the cost of their passage, board, lodging, and various freedom dues. They came from a wide variety of regions and communities: London and its environs, southern and central England, the West Country and, in fewer numbers, from northern counties. Figure 2: Origins of Servants Emigrating from Bristol to the Chesapeake, 1654-1686 Figure 3: Origins of Servants Emigrating from London to the Chesapeake, 1682-1686 Figure 4: Origins of Bristol Servants to the Chesapeake, by Number and Community, 1654-1686 Many were from urban backgrounds and had lived in small market towns, manufacturing centers, provincial capitals, ports, and cities most of their lives or had moved from the countryside a few months or years before taking ship. Those from rural communities came mainly from populous wood pasture districts, forests and fens, and marginal areas. Together they represented a broad spectrum of the young and single, from the destitute and desperate to the lower-middle classes. Particular reasons that prompted servants to emigrate are obscure, but occasionally there are glimpses. Thomas Constable of London was described simply as \"a poor man\" when he emigrated in 1618, and in social rank only marginally above the likes of Robert Kinge, John Bromley, and Jane Wenchman, vagrants plucked off the streets of London and transported as servants of the Virginia Company in the same year. On board the Ann, which docked at Jamestown in September 1623, were artisans and laborers-such as Owen Dawson of St. Martins in the Fields, London, a joiner, Edward Rogers of Purbury, Somerset, a carpenter, and William Kelloway, \"aged 20,\" from Portsmouth, a husbandman-sent to repeople the colony after the great Indian uprising eighteen months earlier had reduced the English population by a third. Thomas Jarvis, a tailor from Bishopsgate, London, was given a �1 \"towards supplying his wants\" by the Drapers Company when he left for Virginia in 1635, and later in the century John Brery of Ottley, Yorkshire, contracted himself for four years, \"Being lately disbanded out of millitary service.\" (3) After having his entire estate confiscated by Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War, Nicholas Fussell, a bookseller of London, was \"reduced to such necessity that he was forct to send two of his Sons [as] Comon Servants to Virginia.\" James Collins from Wolvercot, Oxfordshire, moved to the city sometime after his father died, where he was taken up from the streets as \"an idle boy\" in the summer of 1684. Faced with the choice of being sent to prison for vagrancy or laboring in the plantations, he opted for twelve years service in Virginia. Aboard ship, he might well have met Will Sommersett, formerly of Whitechapel, London, bound for nine years, who had no means of supporting himself after being abandoned by his father. The length of their indentures suggest that both were no more than children when they left England. Loss of one or both parents was common among poor migrants, and parishes routinely rid themselves of the expense and trouble of caring for unwanted children by indenturing them for service overseas. (4) These examples suggest something of the diversity of social backgrounds that characterized English servants during the seventeenth century. At the very bottom of the social ladder were the poor, young, and unemployed who composed the majority of migrants, but there were also skilled men who were doubtless attracted by the high wages on offer in early Jamestown and elsewhere in Virginia. Other young men and women were perhaps impressed by stories of the profits to be made from tobacco, or were persuaded to leave by the prospect of becoming independent landowners after what they construed as an apprenticeship in tobacco husbandry. Some intended to stay for good, some only for a year or two before returning home or moving elsewhere in the colonies. Whatever their backgrounds or reasons for leaving England, whether impoverished and desperate or seeking a new life \"beyond the seas,\" all embarked for Virginia in the hope of making their fortune or at least finding a comfortable sufficiency. During the century, the sheer scale of servant emigration from England transformed a struggling outpost on the further reaches of the English-speaking world into a profitable and populous colony, and ensured the survival of Virginia as the first of many \"Englands out of England\" in America.

Regarding English settlers of the 18th century, one source says 52,000 English migrated during the period of 1701 to 1775, although this figure is likely too low.[22][23] 400,000–450,000 of the 18th-century migrants were Scots, Scots-Irish from Ulster, Germans, Swiss, and French Huguenots.[24] Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants.[25] They numbered 350,000.[26] From 1770 to 1775 (the latter year being when the American Revolutionary War began), 7,000 English, 15,000 Scots, 13,200 Scots-Irish, 5,200 Germans, and 3,900 Irish Catholics migrated to the Thirteen Colonies.[27] According to Butler (2000), up to half of English migrants in the 18th century may have been young, single men who were well-skilled, trained artisans, like the Huguenots.[28] Based on scholarly analysis, English was the largest single ancestry in all U.S. states at the time of the first census in 1790, ranging from a high of 82% in Massachusetts to a low of 35.3% in Pennsylvania, where Germans accounted for 33.3%.",

At times, as many as 75% of the population of some colonies were under terms of indenture. Even on the frontier, according to the 1790 U.S. Census, 6% of the Kentucky population was indentured. Citizens of the colonies would deal with indenture on a daily basis. My intent is to give the reenactor or interpreter some of the background about working beside, owning or having been an indentured servant. This was a labor system, not a system of apprenticeship. (Galenson, 6) The historic basis for indenture grew out of English agricultural servitude and began because of labor shortages in England and in the colonies. It developed at a time when England had a great number of people being displaced from farming. This led to an early growth of the indentured labor system. The importation of white servants under contracts known as indentures proved more profitable as a short-term labor source than enslaving Indians or using free labor. Eventually, the final attempt to ease labor shortages was enslavement of Africans. Wherever you find slavery, you first find indentures. A labor-intensive cash crop such as tobacco required a large work force. The earliest indentured servants were brought to Virginia as farm laborers. The importance of indenture can be seen in Virginia, where in 1618 the colony offered a headright, a grant of 50 acres per servant, as an incentive to planters to import more servants from England. The headright became the property of the owner, not the servant. (Galenson, 12) According to Galenson, &#8220;the basic elements of the system were in use by the Virginia Company by 1620, and may have been worked out earlier &#8230;&#8221;(3) In practice, the servant would sell himself to an agent or ship captain before leaving the British Isles. In turn, the contract would be sold to a buyer in the colonies to recover the cost of the passage. The crossing in steerage was grim. One indentured servant, Thomas Morally, was given three biscuits a day to eat and each mess of five men was given three pints of water per day. Criminals convicted of a capital crime in England could be transported in lieu of a death sentance (for the theft of an item with a cost of as little as one shilling). Servitude also could result from indebtedness, where a person, their spouse or parents owed money, and the person was sold into servitude to recover the debt. In other cases, a parish indentured orphans in order to keep them off the poor roles. Plus, the poor sometimes sold themselves into indenture just to survive. In most cases, the work of the indentured servant would be household or agricultural unskilled labor. There was also a great demand for skilled craftsmen. If an indentured servant had a skill that was in demand, like weaving, smithing or carpentry, the change of negotiating a shorter contract was quite good. In theory, the person is only selling his or her labor. In practice, however, indentured servants were basically slaves and the courts enforced the laws that made it so. The treatment of the servant was harsh and often brutal. In fact, the Virginia Colony prescribed &#8220;bodily punishment for not heeding the commands of the master.&#8221; (Ballagh, 45) Half the servants died in the first two years. As a result of this type of treatment, runaways were frequent. The courts realized this was a problem and started to demand that everyone have identification and travel papers. (A.E. Smith 264-270). If a servant worked their full indenture, they received freedom dues, which were based on Hebrew law from the Old Testament. (Deut. 15:12-15) Many colonies also granted land to the newly freed servant. As reenactors of the eighteenth century, every one of us would interact with indentured servants on a daily basis. A fairly large number of us would have been servants at one time. Yet, at most reenactments, this institution is noticeably lacking, along with travel papers and identification papers. As an early Virginian, John Pory, put it, &#8220;Our principal wealth &#8230; consisteth in servants.&#8221; (Galenson 3) Bibliography: James Curtis Ballagh.

In 1927, proposed quotas based on CPG figures were rejected by the President's Committee chaired by the Secretaries of State, Commerce, and Labor, with the President reporting to Congress \"the statistical and historical information available raises grave doubts as to the whole value of these computations as the basis for the purposes intended\".[30] Concluding that CPG \"had not been accepted by scholars as better than a first approximation of the truth\", an extensive scientific revision was produced, in collaboration with the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), as basis for computing contemporary legal immigration quotas.[31] For this task scholars estimated the proportion of names of unique derivation from each of the major national stocks present in the population as of the 1790 census.

Damon Im-mi-grate&#8212;To enter and settle. &#8230; &#8212;The American Heritage Dictionary God sifted a whole Nation that He might send Choice Grain over into this Wilderness. &#8212;The Reverend Mr. William Stoughton of Massachusetts (1670) This was no ordinary fishing run for the fifty small boats that entered the Florida Strait from Key West on a late April morning last year. Their course was south by southwest to Mariel, 110 miles distant on the northern coast of Cuba. Their mission: to rescue an unknown number of political refugees who had unexpectedly been granted exit visas by Fidel Castro. In the weeks that followed, the fifty-boat squadron was joined by hundreds of other vessels of every size and condition, their passage financed by public funds and by members of the Cuban community in Miami. For more than five months the &#8220;freedom flotilla&#8221; plied the Caribbean, bearing its human cargo to the American mainland. By the end of September, when Castro barred further emigration, 125,000 exiles had reached reception centers in Florida, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania. At the same time, another exodus had taken place from Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest on earth. Between January and late August of 1980, more than 14,000 refugees had crossed the Caribbean to Florida in open, wooden boats, many of them dangerously overloaded and underprovisioned. One small craft, carrying a hundred passengers, had drifted for two weeks in the broiling sun before it was located and towed to safety by a Coast Guard cutter. Like the Cubans, the Haitians spoke bitterly of the hardship and oppression they had left behind. America, they said, offered them freedom and opportunity unavailable elsewhere; they were willing to risk everything for the new life the nation might provide. The admission of such refugees has been replicated over and over again through our history: in 1975 when 120,000 Vietnamese were flown here in the two weeks that followed Saigon&#8217;s fall; in the &#8220;freedom flights&#8221; which brought upward of 300,000 Cubans to Florida between 1965 and 1970; in 1956 when 21,000 Hungarians were airlifted to New Jersey in the aftermath of their abortive uprising; indeed, as long ago as 1793 when nearly 20,000 French exiles from revolution in Santo Domingo sought refuge in Pennsylvania. (The exiles were so destitute that the Pennsylvania Assembly authorized a public subscription on their behalf; Congress voted $15,000 for the cause.) As Thomas Paine had written in Common Sense , it was America&#8217;s unique destiny to &#8220;receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.&#8221; That willingness to welcome the stranger, to offer sanctuary to the oppressed, is firmly based on the democratic ideology of the American Revolution, but it represents as well a pragmatic recognition of the central fact in our existence as a people: since the first Indians crossed the Bering Strait thousands of years ago, the American population has consisted solely of immigrants and their descendants. Immigrants from some 106 distinct ethnic groups&#8212;no one of which constitutes more than one-seventh of the whole&#8212;have transformed our land, shaped our institutions, defined our principles, and formed&#8212;in the words of Charles Andrews&#8212;&#8221;a polychrome, polyglot community&#8221; without parallel in history. FROM A TRICKLE TO A TIDAL WAVE The migration that produced this pluralism is the largest part of a continuing mass movement that far surpasses in magnitude the legendary journeys of the ancient tribes of Israel or of the wandering Germans in the waning days of the Roman Empire. Since 1600 more than 74,000,000 emigrants have abandoned their homelands worldwide. More than two-thirds of them&#8212;some 50,000,000&#8212;have come to the United States. (Nearly a tenth&#8212;over 7,000,000&#8212; have migrated to Canada, the second-ranked &#8220;receiver&#8221; state.) Not all of them remained here; perhaps 9,000,000 or so merely passed through on their way elsewhere or, after a time, returned home. Nonetheless, our net population gain through immigration, from 1607 to the present, is upward of 40,000,000 men, women, and children who came here in hopes that this might be, as Emerson once wrote, &#8220;the country of the Future &#8230; a country of beginnings. &#8230;&#8221; Initially their numbers were few. In the two hundred years that followed Jamestown&#8217;s settlement, immigration was a thin stream flowing out of Europe at irregular intervals. Historians estimate that well under a million immigrants&#8212;perhaps as few as 400,000&#8212;crossed the Atlantic during those two centuries, and some scholars believe that the growth of the nation&#8217;s population&#8212;3,900,000 in the first census of 1790&#8212; was largely the result of natural increase and not of a great influx of the foreign-born. But in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, which had served to bar widespread emigration, the European rivulet became a river and then a flood. Starting in 1820, when a mere 8,385 people (most of them male) passed through the eastern ports of entry, immigration increased decade after decade in quantum jumps. By 1830 annual arrivals numbered 23,322, and a visiting Frenchman wrote glowingly of &#8220;the great flood of civilization&#8221; that was pouring over the American landscape &#8220;with a wonderful power and an admirable regularity. &#8221; In 1840, a total of 84,066 newcomers landed; in 1850 the number had risen to 369,980. Between 1820 and 1860 some 5,000,000 immigrants crossed the seas, their number surpassing in four decades the total 1790 population it had taken nearly two centuries to achieve. With justifiable pride, Oliver Wendell Holmes exulted, &#8220;We are the Romans of the modern world&#8212;the great assimilating people.&#8221; And still the flood rolled on: 2,300,000 arrivals during the 1860&#8217;s; 2,800,000 in the 1870&#8217;s. By 1880 it seemed to some observers that the whole earth was on the move as the human flood became a tidal wave. In the next forty-four years, upward of 25,900,000 men, women, and children were carried to the American shore. Then, in 1924, it ended. Bowing to pressures that had been building since late in the nineteenth century&#8212;from labor, from nativist groups, from state and local leaders, who protested that the nation could no longer absorb so many newcomers&#8212;Congress voted to end three hundred years of open immigration. Revising an earlier law (passed in 1921) that had set a maximum annual quota, Congress now established a rigid system, based on national origins, that limited immigration to an annual ceiling of 150,000 entrants, almost all drawn from northern Europe and the British Isles. The 1924 law took effect five years later when Congress set up an elaborate quota system based upon the 1790 census. Beginning in 1931, immigration totals dropped below 100,000 annually for the first time since 1862 and remained below that figure until 1946. Despite subsequent policy modifications in the postwar years, immigration continued to be restricted, and although some 14,000,000 persons entered the country between 1925 and 1980, annual immigrant totals never again approached the extraordinary levels of the earlier age. To all intents and purposes, the mass migrations that gave the country its special character are now a thing of the past. Since 1920 the native-born population of the United States has steadily increased from 86.8 per cent to an estimated 95.8 per cent in 1980. 1907 was the peak immigration year. A total of 1,285,349 persons entered the country. In 1933 just 23,068 arrived, the lowest number since 1831 and the record for this century. From 1607 to 1924 immigrants totaled about 36,500,000; from 1925 to 1970, about 9,200,000; from 1971 to 1980 an estimated 4,900,000. Since 1968 immigration quotas have permitted a maximum of 170,000 immigrants to enter annually from countries outside the Western Hemisphere (there is a 20,000 ceiling for any one country) and a maximum of 120,000 immigrants annually from countries within the Western Hemisphere on a first-come, first-served basis. Selected categories (&#8220;immediate relatives&#8221; of U.S. citizens or &#8220;special immigrants&#8221; designated by Congress) are granted entry as nonquota immigrants. In recent years legal immigration has averaged about 400,000 per year. In 1980 some 800,000 immigrants entered legally, reflecting the refugee status extended by the government to Cubans, Haitians, and Cambodians. The number of illegal entrants is unknown; estimates range from 1,000,000 to 8,000,000 total during the last decade. The Immigration and Naturalization Service arrests and deports as many as 500,000 border-crossers each year, most of them unskilled workers from Mexico. WHERE WE CAME FROM Despite this century&#8217;s restrictive legislation, the United States continues to receive hundreds of thousands of newcomers each year, with expectations and uncertainties probably no different from those of their predecessors in the era of mass immigration. What makes their experience different are changes in the immigration laws over the past fifteen years that have dramatically altered both the traditional patterns of immigration and the ethnic composition of the immigrant population. Nineteenth-century immigration was essentially European. In the years before 1885 most immigrants came from north of the Alps and west of the Elbe River (the so-called old immigration). After 1885 the greatest number came from Southern and Eastern Europe, notably from Italy and Russia (the &#8220;new immigration&#8221;). The quota laws after World War I generally confirmed and, in the case of the &#8220;old immigration,&#8221; exaggerated that pattern, for the national-origins system was deliberately rigged to favor Northern Europeans over Southern and both at the expense of all others. Since 1968, when the national-origins system was abolished, a significant shift has taken place. In the period from 1820 to 197",

Will Sunday, May 2, 2010 &quot;P hysician, heal yourself ,&quot; said the founder of the church in which Roger Mahony is a cardinal. He is the Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles, and he should heed the founder's admonition before accusing Arizonans of intemperateness. He says that Arizona's new law pertaining to illegal immigration involves &quot; reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation .&quot; &quot;Our highest priority today,&quot; he says, &quot;is to bring calm and reasoning to discussions about our immigrant brothers and sisters.&quot; His idea of calm reasoning is to call Arizona's law for coping with illegal immigration &quot;the country's most retrogressive, mean-spirited, and useless anti-immigrant law.&quot; He also says that it is &quot;dreadful,&quot; &quot;abhorrent&quot; and a &quot;tragedy&quot; and that its assumption is that &quot;immigrants come to our country to rob, plunder and consume public resources.&quot; The problem of illegal immigration is inflaming Mahony, who strongly implies, as advocates for illegal immigrants often do, that any law intended to reduce such illegality is &quot;anti-immigrant.&quot; The implication is: Because most Americans believe such illegality should be reduced, most Americans are against immigrants. This slur is slain by abundant facts -- polling data that show Americans simultaneously committed to controlling the nation's southern border and to welcoming legal immigration. Paul, in his first letter to the Corinthians, said , &quot;And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.&quot; Mahony uncharitably judges Arizona legislators and the constituents they represent to be &quot;mean-spirited.&quot; His evident assumption, one quite common today, is that certain ideas cannot be held by any intelligent person of goodwill. But what does -- what can -- Mahony mean by asserting that Arizona's law is &quot;useless&quot;? He must believe either it will have no effect on illegal immigration or that any effect must be without social value. He can know neither to be true. Late-night comedians, recalling World War II movies in which Gestapo officers demand &quot;show me your papers,&quot; find echoes of fascism in Arizona's belief that there are occasions when police officers can reasonably ask for someone's documentation. On Tuesday, Barack Obama, showing contempt for the professionalism and character of police officers, said: &quot;Now suddenly if you don't have your papers and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're going to be harassed.&quot; Time was, presidents were held to higher standards than comedians. Today's liberals favor indignation over information, but lawyer Obama must know that since 1952 federal law has said : &quot;Every alien, eighteen years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him.&quot; In today's debate, the threshold question is: Should the nation have immigration laws? Until 1875, there were none. There are strict libertarians who believe there should be none. But the vast majority who do not favor completely open borders believe that there should be some laws restricting who can become residents, and presumably they believe that such laws should be enforced. Once Americans are satisfied that the borders are secure, the immigration policies they will favor will reflect their -- and the law enforcement profession's -- healthy aversion to the measures that would be necessary to remove from the nation the nearly 11 million illegal immigrants, 60 percent of whom have been here for more than five years. It would take 200,000 buses in a bumper-to-bumper convoy 1,700 miles long to carry them back to the border. Americans are not going to seek and would not tolerate the police methods that would be needed to round up and deport the equivalent of the population of Ohio. Meanwhile, hysteria about domestic fascism is unhelpful, even though it is a liberal tradition. In his 1944 State of the Union address , FDR identified opponents of his domestic agenda as fascists. Declaring that his &quot;one supreme objective&quot; was &quot;security,&quot; including &quot;economic security, social security, moral security,&quot; he issued a dire warning: Woodrow Wilson's progressive policies had been frustrated by &quot;rightist reaction,&quot; and &quot;if history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called 'normalcy' of the 1920s -- then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.&quot; Today's hysterics are unoriginal. But they learned their bad manners from a master.

Houston had become a thriving city of 44,633, with the population of Harris County being 63,786. This put Harris County in the third place in the state, edging Grayson County by less than 100 and trailing Dallas County with 82,726, and Bexar County with 69,422. By the turn of the century, the United States had become the world's foremost industrial country, with a population larger than any European country save Russia and with exports greater than those of the United Kingdom. The country by that time was producing 31.9 percent of the world's coal, 34.1 percent of its iron and 36.7 percent of its steel. The trend from the farm to the city had started, with less than four workers in 10 being in agriculture and with four families out of 10 already living in urban areas. The business man had become an important figure in society. The first decade of the new century saw the United States adopt the gold standard, start construction of the Panama Canal, and initiate the income tax. The Wright brothers made their first heavier-than-air flight in 1903, but six years later the endurance record was still standing at only one hour, one minute and 40 seconds. Bleriot made the first airplane flight across the English Channel in 1909. Immigration reached an all-time high, with 8,795,386 for the decade, and 1,285,349 in 1907 alone. In 1900, the United States had 18,000,000 horses and mules, 10,000,000 bicycles, and only 4,000 automobiles. Carry Nation started her anti-saloon career, and New York City made it illegal for women to smoke in public places. The era of modern skyscrapers began, with the 47-foot Singer Building in 1908 and the 50-story Metropolitan Tower and the 60-story Woolworth Building five years later, all in New York City. With the coming of a new century, Texas was on the threshold of a new era. It had organized local government, railroads to supply transportation to all developed sections of the state, a public school system with a number of institutions of higher learning, and the first stages of a period of industrialization. Although oil had been produced in the Corsicana area prior to 1900, the gusher at Spindletop in 1901 indicated to the world the potential oil wealth in Texas. Oil and gas gave the state the fuel supplies it had been lacking. It was not, however, until 1927 and 1928, respectively, that Texas became the number one state in the production of natural gas and oil. With the spectacular discovery of oil at Spindletop in 1901, the economy of Texas began to change perceptibly. The state became identified with the oil industry, although the first stage of the rapid oil-industry transformation waited to coincide with World War I and the rising momentum of the motor industry. Writing of the &quot;Spindletop&quot; development in their book by that name, Michael T. Halbouty and James A. Clark said: &quot;There, on January 10, 1901, a new age of human progress was born when the first great oil gusher roared in. There and then America was blessed with the supply of energy and the incentive to move up from secondary position in world affairs to that of undisputed leadership. Before Spindletop, oil was used for lamps and lubrication. The famous Lucas gusher changed that. It started the liquid fuel age, which brought forth the automobile, the airplane, the network of highways, improved railroad and marine transportation, the era of mass production, and untold comforts and conveniences.&quot; Texas started the century with good business conditions; and in a new spirit of unity and vision, the people of the state plunged into an aggressive campaign for economic development. Urban growth and the enhanced influence of business brought new forces into the economic limelight of Texas. Under these circumstances, the Chamber of Commerce movement in the state entered a new period of influence and effectiveness. The foremost objective of the Houston Chamber of Commerce continued to be a deepwater port. Not all of the people in Houston shared its enthusiasm that a port miles inland would prove profitable. Galveston uniformly ridiculed the idea and could hardly believe that Houston could be serious about the proposal. The &quot;Galveston News&quot; chuckled editorially when Galveston merchant Sampson Heidenheimer's six barge loads of salt melted in a rain and ran into Buffalo Bayou en route to Houston. Its headlines announced: &quot;Houston at last has a salt water port. God Almighty furnished the water; Heidenheimer furnished the salt!&quot; Suddenly, however, a hurricane-tidal wave smashed across Galveston Island on September 8-9, 1900, costing probably 8,000 lives and property losses in uncountable millions of dollars. As the advantages of a protected, inland port became apparent, the balance of commercial power began to shift toward Houston, which jumped from third to first place among Texas cities in the volume of commerce and industry, with bank deposits reaching $5,265,981. After the Houston Chamber of Commerce redoubled its efforts, President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902 signed a bill appropriating one million dollars for Houston's port. On March 3, 1905, Congress modified the project by locating the terminus at the head of deep water at &quot;Long Reach,&quot; the present Turning Basin, which was dredged to 18.5-foot depth in 1906-1907. Other appropriations were slow on the proposed 25-foot depth. Realizing that some extraordinary effort would have to be made if the project were to be completed in any reasonable time, the Chamber of Commerce organized a delegation to propose to the national government that they be permitted to continue contracting for the 25-foot channel from Bolivar Roads to the Turning Basin and that the taxpayers of Harris County would pay one-half of the construction cost, as well as providing adequate publicly owned water-terminal facilities. The delegation was headed by Mayor Baldwin Rice, nephew of William Marsh Rice. This novel proposition was promptly accepted by the Congress, and the Texas State Legislature enacted the necessary Navigation District Law. On June 25, 1910, Congress appropriated one-half of the estimated $2,500,000 costs with &quot;local interest to pay one-half thereof.&quot; The final contract was for $2,412,595.66, and the Navigation District paid its half, or $1,206,297.83, contributing an additional $200,000 towards the construction cost of two dredges for maintenance work. This negotiation resulted in a new national policy of local participation in river and harbor work. Shortly after 1900, the Chamber of Commerce helped secure $100,000 to pave the muddy extension on Main Street, and in another project, the Chamber of Commerce marshaled civic-minded citizens in the creation of the Museum of Fine Arts. President William McKinley came to Houston May 3, 1901, to make a major address, and President William Howard Taft spoke from the balcony of the Rice Hotel in 1909. He was the third national president to visit Houston while holding office, President Benjamin Harrison having spoken here in 1891. The coming of the automobile created a demand for a good roads movement for which Chambers of Commerce supplied the initiative and leadership. However, efforts in 1903 failed to get the Texas Legislature to establish a Bureau of Highways to provide engineering counsel to counties on road building. Industrial interest was stimulated by a tour of Texas businessmen to Chicago and other Midwestern centers and by the creation of the Texas Industrial Association. It was recognized that adequate supplies of water, electric power and fuel were basic to the location of industry, and the Houston Chamber of Commerce addressed itself to these goals, to a study of the effect of legislative measures on industry, and to efforts for legislation to encourage the investment of home and foreign capital in Texas enterprises. John Kirby Allen, sometimes called the &quot;father of industrial Texas,&quot; declared that &quot;Texas today is on the high road to marvelous achievements.&quot; He said the state needed a &quot;concert of action&quot; to &quot;bring to our borders the brain and the brawn and the capital of our sister states and of foreign countries.&quot; Sections The Decades Our Legacy Great Citizens Preservation Our Community Houston Voices 1836-1839 1840-1850 1850-1860 1860-1870 1870-1880 1880-1890 1890-1900 1900-1910 1910-1920 1920-1930 1930-1940 1940-1945 1945-1950 1950-1955 1955-1960 1960-1965 1965-1970 1970-1980 1980-1990 1990-2000 Related TIMELINE 1900-1910 Updates Events | Schedule Our Vintage Sponsors &copy; Copyright 2009 HoustonHistory.com.

Damon Im-mi-grate&#8212;To enter and settle. &#8230; &#8212;The American Heritage Dictionary God sifted a whole Nation that He might send Choice Grain over into this Wilderness. &#8212;The Reverend Mr. William Stoughton of Massachusetts (1670) This was no ordinary fishing run for the fifty small boats that entered the Florida Strait from Key West on a late April morning last year. Their course was south by southwest to Mariel, 110 miles distant on the northern coast of Cuba. Their mission: to rescue an unknown number of political refugees who had unexpectedly been granted exit visas by Fidel Castro. In the weeks that followed, the fifty-boat squadron was joined by hundreds of other vessels of every size and condition, their passage financed by public funds and by members of the Cuban community in Miami. For more than five months the &#8220;freedom flotilla&#8221; plied the Caribbean, bearing its human cargo to the American mainland. By the end of September, when Castro barred further emigration, 125,000 exiles had reached reception centers in Florida, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania. At the same time, another exodus had taken place from Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest on earth. Between January and late August of 1980, more than 14,000 refugees had crossed the Caribbean to Florida in open, wooden boats, many of them dangerously overloaded and underprovisioned. One small craft, carrying a hundred passengers, had drifted for two weeks in the broiling sun before it was located and towed to safety by a Coast Guard cutter. Like the Cubans, the Haitians spoke bitterly of the hardship and oppression they had left behind. America, they said, offered them freedom and opportunity unavailable elsewhere; they were willing to risk everything for the new life the nation might provide. The admission of such refugees has been replicated over and over again through our history: in 1975 when 120,000 Vietnamese were flown here in the two weeks that followed Saigon&#8217;s fall; in the &#8220;freedom flights&#8221; which brought upward of 300,000 Cubans to Florida between 1965 and 1970; in 1956 when 21,000 Hungarians were airlifted to New Jersey in the aftermath of their abortive uprising; indeed, as long ago as 1793 when nearly 20,000 French exiles from revolution in Santo Domingo sought refuge in Pennsylvania. (The exiles were so destitute that the Pennsylvania Assembly authorized a public subscription on their behalf; Congress voted $15,000 for the cause.) As Thomas Paine had written in Common Sense , it was America&#8217;s unique destiny to &#8220;receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.&#8221; That willingness to welcome the stranger, to offer sanctuary to the oppressed, is firmly based on the democratic ideology of the American Revolution, but it represents as well a pragmatic recognition of the central fact in our existence as a people: since the first Indians crossed the Bering Strait thousands of years ago, the American population has consisted solely of immigrants and their descendants. Immigrants from some 106 distinct ethnic groups&#8212;no one of which constitutes more than one-seventh of the whole&#8212;have transformed our land, shaped our institutions, defined our principles, and formed&#8212;in the words of Charles Andrews&#8212;&#8221;a polychrome, polyglot community&#8221; without parallel in history. FROM A TRICKLE TO A TIDAL WAVE The migration that produced this pluralism is the largest part of a continuing mass movement that far surpasses in magnitude the legendary journeys of the ancient tribes of Israel or of the wandering Germans in the waning days of the Roman Empire. Since 1600 more than 74,000,000 emigrants have abandoned their homelands worldwide. More than two-thirds of them&#8212;some 50,000,000&#8212;have come to the United States. (Nearly a tenth&#8212;over 7,000,000&#8212; have migrated to Canada, the second-ranked &#8220;receiver&#8221; state.) Not all of them remained here; perhaps 9,000,000 or so merely passed through on their way elsewhere or, after a time, returned home. Nonetheless, our net population gain through immigration, from 1607 to the present, is upward of 40,000,000 men, women, and children who came here in hopes that this might be, as Emerson once wrote, &#8220;the country of the Future &#8230; a country of beginnings. &#8230;&#8221; Initially their numbers were few. In the two hundred years that followed Jamestown&#8217;s settlement, immigration was a thin stream flowing out of Europe at irregular intervals. Historians estimate that well under a million immigrants&#8212;perhaps as few as 400,000&#8212;crossed the Atlantic during those two centuries, and some scholars believe that the growth of the nation&#8217;s population&#8212;3,900,000 in the first census of 1790&#8212; was largely the result of natural increase and not of a great influx of the foreign-born. But in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, which had served to bar widespread emigration, the European rivulet became a river and then a flood. Starting in 1820, when a mere 8,385 people (most of them male) passed through the eastern ports of entry, immigration increased decade after decade in quantum jumps. By 1830 annual arrivals numbered 23,322, and a visiting Frenchman wrote glowingly of &#8220;the great flood of civilization&#8221; that was pouring over the American landscape &#8220;with a wonderful power and an admirable regularity. &#8221; In 1840, a total of 84,066 newcomers landed; in 1850 the number had risen to 369,980. Between 1820 and 1860 some 5,000,000 immigrants crossed the seas, their number surpassing in four decades the total 1790 population it had taken nearly two centuries to achieve. With justifiable pride, Oliver Wendell Holmes exulted, &#8220;We are the Romans of the modern world&#8212;the great assimilating people.&#8221; And still the flood rolled on: 2,300,000 arrivals during the 1860&#8217;s; 2,800,000 in the 1870&#8217;s. By 1880 it seemed to some observers that the whole earth was on the move as the human flood became a tidal wave. In the next forty-four years, upward of 25,900,000 men, women, and children were carried to the American shore. Then, in 1924, it ended. Bowing to pressures that had been building since late in the nineteenth century&#8212;from labor, from nativist groups, from state and local leaders, who protested that the nation could no longer absorb so many newcomers&#8212;Congress voted to end three hundred years of open immigration. Revising an earlier law (passed in 1921) that had set a maximum annual quota, Congress now established a rigid system, based on national origins, that limited immigration to an annual ceiling of 150,000 entrants, almost all drawn from northern Europe and the British Isles. The 1924 law took effect five years later when Congress set up an elaborate quota system based upon the 1790 census. Beginning in 1931, immigration totals dropped below 100,000 annually for the first time since 1862 and remained below that figure until 1946. Despite subsequent policy modifications in the postwar years, immigration continued to be restricted, and although some 14,000,000 persons entered the country between 1925 and 1980, annual immigrant totals never again approached the extraordinary levels of the earlier age. To all intents and purposes, the mass migrations that gave the country its special character are now a thing of the past. Since 1920 the native-born population of the United States has steadily increased from 86.8 per cent to an estimated 95.8 per cent in 1980. 1907 was the peak immigration year. A total of 1,285,349 persons entered the country. In 1933 just 23,068 arrived, the lowest number since 1831 and the record for this century. From 1607 to 1924 immigrants totaled about 36,500,000; from 1925 to 1970, about 9,200,000; from 1971 to 1980 an estimated 4,900,000. Since 1968 immigration quotas have permitted a maximum of 170,000 immigrants to enter annually from countries outside the Western Hemisphere (there is a 20,000 ceiling for any one country) and a maximum of 120,000 immigrants annually from countries within the Western Hemisphere on a first-come, first-served basis. Selected categories (&#8220;immediate relatives&#8221; of U.S. citizens or &#8220;special immigrants&#8221; designated by Congress) are granted entry as nonquota immigrants. In recent years legal immigration has averaged about 400,000 per year. In 1980 some 800,000 immigrants entered legally, reflecting the refugee status extended by the government to Cubans, Haitians, and Cambodians. The number of illegal entrants is unknown; estimates range from 1,000,000 to 8,000,000 total during the last decade. The Immigration and Naturalization Service arrests and deports as many as 500,000 border-crossers each year, most of them unskilled workers from Mexico. WHERE WE CAME FROM Despite this century&#8217;s restrictive legislation, the United States continues to receive hundreds of thousands of newcomers each year, with expectations and uncertainties probably no different from those of their predecessors in the era of mass immigration. What makes their experience different are changes in the immigration laws over the past fifteen years that have dramatically altered both the traditional patterns of immigration and the ethnic composition of the immigrant population. Nineteenth-century immigration was essentially European. In the years before 1885 most immigrants came from north of the Alps and west of the Elbe River (the so-called old immigration). After 1885 the greatest number came from Southern and Eastern Europe, notably from Italy and Russia (the &#8220;new immigration&#8221;). The quota laws after World War I generally confirmed and, in the case of the &#8220;old immigration,&#8221; exaggerated that pattern, for the national-origins system was deliberately rigged to favor Northern Europeans over Southern and both at the expense of all others. Since 1968, when the national-origins system was abolished, a significant shift has taken place. In the period from 1820 to 197",

Reporting from Sanaa, journalist Yousef Mawry said the presidential palace in Aden had also been overtaken by Yemeni government forces, who also seized control of all exit and entry points to the city. Some officials from the STC, however, said the group is still in control of Aden. Mawry reported 10 government soldiers had been killed and wounded in the city of Ataq, in Shabwah province, another stronghold of the secessionist movement. Yemen’s separatist authorities imposed a night-time curfew in Aden. The 9pm to 6am (18:00 GMT to 03:00 GMT) curfew was announced by STC deputy leader Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, who is in charge of armed forces patrolling the southern city. ‘Unknown location’ In a statement, the coalition said the leader of the STC, Aidarous al-Zubaidi , was due to fly out from the Yemeni city of Aden for talks on ending the conflict between his group and the internationally recognised government of Yemen. Advertisement But al-Zubaidi did not board the plane and “fled to an unknown location”, it said. His current whereabouts remain unclear. “During this time, the legitimate government and the coalition received information that al-Zubaidi had mobilised a large force, including armoured and combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, as well as munitions,” the coalition said. The force left Aden at around midnight and was later located in the southern Dhale governorate, it added. The coalition launched “preemptive strikes” at 4am local time (01:00 GMT) to disable those forces and thwart al-Zubaidi’s “attempt to escalate the conflict”. Contact lost The fast-moving crisis in Yemen has ignited a feud between the two most powerful countries in the oil-rich Gulf – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – and fractured a coalition headed by Yemen’s internationally recognised government that is fighting the Iran-backed Houthis. Matthew Bryza, an adviser to the Southern Transitional Council that the UAE backs, told Al Jazeera al-Zubaidi avoided attending talks in Riyadh because he feared being detained. “The key to de-escalate now will have to be to have a real negotiation in a neutral venue,” he said, adding the reported detention of STC members in Riyadh has further undermined prospects for substantive talks. The Saudi-led coalition said the STC delegation, excluding al-Zubaidi, departed Yemen for Riyadh in the early hours. The STC later issued a statement calling on Saudi Arabia to halt air strikes, adding ‌that they ‌lost contact ⁠with their delegation in Riyadh. Senior STC official Amr Al Beidh said Aden is still under the group’s control. ‍The STC said al-Zubaidi is in Aden and “continues his duties”. Al-Zubaidi was removed from government for “committing high treason”, said the internationally recognised Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) holding executive power. “This does not mean the victory of one party over another, and there is no room for gloating or portraying what happened as a defeat for this one or a gain for that one,” PLC Vice President Abdullah al-Alimi said in a post on X. The UAE has pursued an assertive foreign policy and carved its own sphere of influence across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy in the spotlight after its rare military escalation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen. ‘Going to be imprisoned’ Hisham al-Omeisy, a political and conflict analyst focusing on Yemen, said Saudi Arabia managed to “pull a rug” from underneath al-Zubaidi and peel away some of his key partners within the PLC, as well as some of the tribal supporters he had in Yemen. Advertisement “The Saudis kind of diluted his clout, his political leverage inside the country, and this is one of the reasons why he feared for himself. By boarding the plane, he would have felt like they already took the air out of him and that he was basically going to be imprisoned in Riyadh,” he told Al Jazeera. The STC, which initially supported Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen, launched an offensive against Saudi-backed government troops in December, seeking an independent state in the south. Their advance aimed to control broad swaths of southern Yemen, including the Hadramout and Mahra provinces, in defiance of warnings from Riyadh. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia, while Mahra is close to the border. Together, the provinces make up nearly half of Yemeni territory. Riyadh responded with air strikes on the Yemeni port of Mukalla on December 30, targeting what it called a UAE-linked weapons shipment , and backed a call by the internationally recognised government for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country. Abu Dhabi denied that the shipment contained weapons and expressed a commitment to ensure Riyadh’s security. Shortly afterwards, it announced an end to what it called its “counterterrorism mission” in Yemen. Yemeni government troops, backed by Saudi Arabian air attacks, went on to reclaim Hadramout and Mahra, and the STC said on Saturday it would attend peace talks hosted by Saudi Arabia. aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo Advertisement",

Middle East Southern Yemen separatist group says it will dissolve after its head fled to the UAE Updated January 9, 2026 2:23 PM ET Originally published January 9, 2026 9:33 AM ET By The Associated Press This is a locator map for Yemen with its capital, Sanaa. AP hide caption toggle caption AP CAIRO — Yemen's main separatist group and its institutions will be dismantled effective Friday, the group's secretary-general said, following weeks of unrest in areas of southern Yemen and a day after its leader fled to the United Arab Emirates. Abdulrahman Jalal al-Sebaihi said the Southern Transitional Council would shut down all of its bodies and offices inside and outside Yemen, citing internal disagreements and mounting regional pressure. Middle East Yemen's separatists announce a constitution for an independent south But that decision was contested by the council's spokesman, Anwar al-Tamimi, who said on X that only the full council, under its president, can take such steps — highlighting the internal divisions within the separatist movement. Yemen has been mired for more than a decade in a civil war that involves a complex interplay of sectarian and tribal grievances and the involvement of regional powers. The Iran-aligned Houthis control the most populous regions of the country in the north, including the capital Sanaa. Meanwhile, a loose regional coalition of powers — including Saudi Arabia and the UAE — has backed the internationally recognized government in the south. Sponsor Message The separatists seize territory, then lose it The turmoil follows an advance last month by STC forces into the governorates of Hadramout and al-Mahra, where they seized oil-rich areas and facilities and the presidential palace in the main southern city of Aden. Those moves pushed out the Saudi-aligned National Shield Forces, and brought tensions between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi into the open. The Saudi-backed forces have since regained control of Hadramout, the presidential palace in Aden and camps in al-Mahra. In explaining the STC's dissolution, al-Sebaihi said the council had not approved the military operations, which he said fractured unity in the south and \"damaged relations with the Saudi-led coalition.\" As a result, \"the council's continued existence no longer serves the purpose for which it was established,\" al-Sebaihi said. The STC was established in April 2017 as an umbrella organization for groups that seek to restore southern Yemen as an independent state, as it was between 1967 and 1990. Al-Sebaihi said the group's members would now focus on achieving a \"fair\" solution for Yemen's south and prepare for a conference in the Saudi capital. A win for the Saudis The military operations by the STC on Saudi Arabia's borders were viewed as a threat to the kingdom's national security, and Saudi officials welcomed the council's announcement that it would dissolve. Sponsor Message Saudi Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman said the southern issue is now on a \"real path nurtured by the kingdom and endorsed by the international community.\" Mohamed al-Jaber, the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, called the decision \"courageous\" and said the Riyadh conference would include all influential southern figures. A date for the conference has not been announced yet. Yemen's Shura Council, which is backed by the internationally recognized government, also welcomed the STC decision, and said the southern issue should be solved through \"a comprehensive political process.\" Abdulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, said Friday that Saudi Arabia managed to contain the situation on the ground. \"Riyadh has proven that it will not allow any foreign interference to change the Yemeni roadmap by supporting one side over another, especially if force is used and chaos continues to threaten the security of Yemen, the region, and the world,\" he said in a comment on X. Separatist leader flees to the United Arab Emirates The STC announcement comes a day after the council's leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi fled Yemen to the UAE. The Presidential Leadership Council said the STC leader was charged with treason after he reportedly declined to travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for meetings, and after he deployed STC forces to head to al-Dahle, where his village is located. The STC's national assembly had called for a march Saturday in Aden and Hadramout's port city of Mukalla in support of the \"right to self-determination\" in Yemen's south and in support of al-Zubaidi. However, it's unclear whether the march will still take place with the announcement of the council being dissolved. A curfew imposed earlier across Aden due to the security situation was lifted Friday, according to Presidential Leadership Council member Abu Zarae Al-Mahremy, who is responsible for overseeing security across Aden.

Hadi, who was under rebel imposed house arrest until last month when he fled to Aden in the south of the country, accused Shiite Huthi militia of importing Tehran's ideology into Yemen. In the broadcast, Hadi said he would \"ensure the Yemeni republic flag will fly on the Marran Mountain instead of the Iranian flag.\" In September, the Houthis overtook Yemen's capital, Sanaa, inluding Marran Mountain, seizing many state institutions. Since then they have also taken over nine of the country's 21 provinces. Temporary capital Locked in a power struggle with Houthi rebels, Hadi Saturday declared the port city of Aden Yemen's temporary capital. \"My move to Aden was not a step towards separation,\" despite claims to this effect from the \"coup plotters,\" Hadi said in the address broadcast on official Aden TV. \"My aim is to safeguard the legitimate state institutions.\" \"Aden is an economic and temporary capital,\" he added. Hadi's televised address comes one day after suicide bombers killed more than 130 people in twin-attacks on mosques in Sanaa. The bombers blew themselves up during noon prayers at the Badr and Al-Hashahush mosques, situated on opposite sides of the city, witnesses and officials said Friday. The self-styled \"Islamic State\" claimed responsibility for the attack. The mosques are frequented by Shiite Houthi rebels, allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who have control of the capital. Meanwhile, US broadcaster CNN reported Saturday that Washington was evacuating 100 Special Forces troops from Yemen because of the unstable political situation in the country. This came after al Qaeda fighters reportedly seized the southern city of al-Houta, not far from the Al Anad air base where the US troops are stationed. Howerver, Reuters on Saturday reported, citing local officials and residents, that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had been driven back out of the southern city on Saturday. Al-Houta is only around 30 kilometers (roughly 20 miles) from the \"temporary capital\" of Aden declared as President Hadi's interim headquarters. jlw/msh (Reuters, dpa, AFP, AP) Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Yemen and the Middle East strongman game Yemen and the Middle East strongman game The foreign ministers of the Arab League will be meeting on Monday in Cairo to go over ways to help Yemen avert political chaos.

Weeks of fighting between armed groups have left nearly 200 people dead and the city starved of water, fuel and electricity. Hospitals struggle to obtain anesthetic and dressings. Barefoot, nervous teenagers with matted hair and guns mind checkpoints on the treacherous roads. Gun battles sweep across the city while residents lie low and worry that there is worse suffering to come. “The war of hunger has not started — yet,” said Ali Bamatraf, a grocer with dwindling stocks, standing among empty food boxes that would not soon be replaced. As war engulfs Yemen, no place in the beleaguered country has suffered as severely as Aden, a southern port city captive to ferocious street fighting for the better part of a harrowing month. Foreign navies patrol its waters and warplanes circle above, blockading a city that is steadily crumbling under reckless fire from tanks and heavy guns. “Damaged. Ruined,” said Faris al-Shuaibi, a professor of English literature at Aden University, searching for the words to describe the beaten-up neighborhood around him. “Everything is destroyed.” The clashes began in mid-March as a feud between forces allied with two members of Yemen’s political elite: southern fighters loyal to President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who had retreated to Aden after being driven from the capital , against Houthi militiamen and security forces allied with Ali Abdullah Saleh , Yemen’s former leader. Weeks later, the war has spread and become far more complicated. Saudi Arabia unleashed an air offensive last month that so far has failed in its primary goal: to stop the Houthi advance. Saudi officials are threatening a ground invasion, seeing the hand of Iran , their regional nemesis, behind the Houthis, whose leaders follow an offshoot of Shiite Islam. For many residents of Aden, though, each day has only simplified the conflict, reducing it to an existential fight. After Mr. Hadi and most of his loyal fighters quit the city, residents dusted off personal weapons and formed their own units to fight the advance of the Houthis and their allies — the latest northern invaders, they say, seeking to dominate the south. North and South Yemen were separate countries until 1990 and fought a brief civil war four years later. For decades, southern grievances over ill treatment by the rulers in the northern capital, Sana, have festered, escalating in recent years into a movement openly calling for secession. Professor Shuaibi was among thousands of people protesting peacefully a few months ago in Aden for an independent state, in a square adorned with pictures of southerners who had died in wars and at the hands of Mr. Saleh’s security forces. On Thursday, he was back in the streets with a gun, preparing to join other residents fighting in the central district of Al Mualla. The local militias are loosely organized, dominated by young men focused on securing their own neighborhoods, said Jamal Khulaqi, a 25-year-old Yemeni-American from Buffalo who said he was helping with relief efforts in the city. Most lack training and weapons apart from AK-47s. Their opponents are mostly security men loyal to Mr. Saleh, known for their repression back when they were in power. Now, as militiamen, residents say, they are unrestrained and more brutal. “They are bombing innocent people, families,” Professor Shuaibi said. The Houthis, fighting all over the country, are a smaller part of the force in Aden, their ranks filled with many teenagers and even some children. Some of the young Houthis who had been captured seemed filled with religious zeal and said they had been told they were going to Aden to fight Al Qaeda , the Sunni extremists the Houthis regard as their principal foe, Professor Shuaibi said. “There is no Al Qaeda here,” he said. The city has been carved up into sectors guarded by fighters with guns slung over their shoulders, drained by the stresses of war but still full of swagger. One fighter, Mohamed Saleh Salem, 38, called the local fighters “ferocious” and vowed that the Houthis would not advance, while adding that he had not had a bath in days. The Houthis and their allies, armed with tanks and other heavy weapons, have captured several strategic areas, including a coastal road. But their hold on the city remains shaky, and they are vulnerable to repeated attacks by the local groups, which are fighting in familiar neighborhoods. Saudi-Backed Forces Gain Momentum Annotated maps showing the Houthi rebels’ drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical divisions. The Houthi forces respond savagely to any assault, Mr. Khulaqi said. “When someone shoots at them, they fire on buildings,” he said as he drove a friend through the city’s checkpoints to catch the only bus still shuttling people out of Aden and across the country to the Saudi border. As dangerous as it is to travel outside the city, it has become deadly to stay. Volunteer medics said that at least 198 people had been killed and nearly 2,000 people injured in the city since March 25. The estimate was probably conservative: Ambulances have not been able to reach people in neighborhoods with the heaviest fighting, said Khadeja bin Bourek, a volunteer aid worker, who said there was also a shortage of medics at government hospitals. Valerie Pierre, the project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Aden, said an average of 15 to 20 patients, most of them gunshot victims, arrived every day at a hospital where the group is working and living. The group had just received its first shipment of medical supplies by boat from the tiny East African nation of Djibouti, across a narrow strait from Aden, but still had only a third of the supplies it needed. Ms. Pierre, a midwife, arrived in Aden in January, finding a “beautiful city, a very historic place.” Now, she and the doctors are sequestered, listening to gun battles, sometimes distant, sometimes just outside the hospital walls. “I am full of adrenaline, so I am still running, still motivated,” she said. “It is very scary.” Elsewhere in the city, residents were hauling water in buckets because water tanks supplying at least four districts had been destroyed or cut off by the fighting. In many places, electricity was only available a few hours each day. Only local neighborhood stores were open, and by 7 p.m., the streets were empty, except for the fighters. Saudi airstrikes have mostly targeted the outskirts of the city, in an attempt to cut off the supply lines of the Houthis and their allies. There also appears to have been shelling from warships, though no one seems to know for sure. “Aden is almost the only city in Yemen to be attacked by air, sea and land,” said Nashwan al-Othmani, a resident. The siege has left little time to think about the political arguments dividing the country. No one seems to be clamoring for the return of Mr. Hadi, whom the Saudis have vowed to restore as president. “There are many who criticize Hadi,” Mr. Othmani said. “There are many who accuse him of bringing the struggle to Aden and then leaving.” Fathi Bin-Lazrq reported from Aden, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.

Reporting from Sanaa, journalist Yousef Mawry said the presidential palace in Aden had also been overtaken by Yemeni government forces, who also seized control of all exit and entry points to the city. Some officials from the STC, however, said the group is still in control of Aden. Mawry reported 10 government soldiers had been killed and wounded in the city of Ataq, in Shabwah province, another stronghold of the secessionist movement. Yemen’s separatist authorities imposed a night-time curfew in Aden. The 9pm to 6am (18:00 GMT to 03:00 GMT) curfew was announced by STC deputy leader Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, who is in charge of armed forces patrolling the southern city. ‘Unknown location’ In a statement, the coalition said the leader of the STC, Aidarous al-Zubaidi , was due to fly out from the Yemeni city of Aden for talks on ending the conflict between his group and the internationally recognised government of Yemen. Advertisement But al-Zubaidi did not board the plane and “fled to an unknown location”, it said. His current whereabouts remain unclear. “During this time, the legitimate government and the coalition received information that al-Zubaidi had mobilised a large force, including armoured and combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, as well as munitions,” the coalition said. The force left Aden at around midnight and was later located in the southern Dhale governorate, it added. The coalition launched “preemptive strikes” at 4am local time (01:00 GMT) to disable those forces and thwart al-Zubaidi’s “attempt to escalate the conflict”. Contact lost The fast-moving crisis in Yemen has ignited a feud between the two most powerful countries in the oil-rich Gulf – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – and fractured a coalition headed by Yemen’s internationally recognised government that is fighting the Iran-backed Houthis. Matthew Bryza, an adviser to the Southern Transitional Council that the UAE backs, told Al Jazeera al-Zubaidi avoided attending talks in Riyadh because he feared being detained. “The key to de-escalate now will have to be to have a real negotiation in a neutral venue,” he said, adding the reported detention of STC members in Riyadh has further undermined prospects for substantive talks. The Saudi-led coalition said the STC delegation, excluding al-Zubaidi, departed Yemen for Riyadh in the early hours. The STC later issued a statement calling on Saudi Arabia to halt air strikes, adding ‌that they ‌lost contact ⁠with their delegation in Riyadh. Senior STC official Amr Al Beidh said Aden is still under the group’s control. ‍The STC said al-Zubaidi is in Aden and “continues his duties”. Al-Zubaidi was removed from government for “committing high treason”, said the internationally recognised Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) holding executive power. “This does not mean the victory of one party over another, and there is no room for gloating or portraying what happened as a defeat for this one or a gain for that one,” PLC Vice President Abdullah al-Alimi said in a post on X. The UAE has pursued an assertive foreign policy and carved its own sphere of influence across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy in the spotlight after its rare military escalation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen. ‘Going to be imprisoned’ Hisham al-Omeisy, a political and conflict analyst focusing on Yemen, said Saudi Arabia managed to “pull a rug” from underneath al-Zubaidi and peel away some of his key partners within the PLC, as well as some of the tribal supporters he had in Yemen. Advertisement “The Saudis kind of diluted his clout, his political leverage inside the country, and this is one of the reasons why he feared for himself. By boarding the plane, he would have felt like they already took the air out of him and that he was basically going to be imprisoned in Riyadh,” he told Al Jazeera. The STC, which initially supported Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen, launched an offensive against Saudi-backed government troops in December, seeking an independent state in the south. Their advance aimed to control broad swaths of southern Yemen, including the Hadramout and Mahra provinces, in defiance of warnings from Riyadh. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia, while Mahra is close to the border. Together, the provinces make up nearly half of Yemeni territory. Riyadh responded with air strikes on the Yemeni port of Mukalla on December 30, targeting what it called a UAE-linked weapons shipment , and backed a call by the internationally recognised government for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country. Abu Dhabi denied that the shipment contained weapons and expressed a commitment to ensure Riyadh’s security. Shortly afterwards, it announced an end to what it called its “counterterrorism mission” in Yemen. Yemeni government troops, backed by Saudi Arabian air attacks, went on to reclaim Hadramout and Mahra, and the STC said on Saturday it would attend peace talks hosted by Saudi Arabia. aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo Advertisement",

The deployment comes as the government accelerates efforts to consolidate control over southern provinces, following days of military and political setbacks for the STC and amid reports that its leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, had fled the country. According to military sources aligned with Yemen&rsquo;s Presidential Leadership Council, units of the National Shield Forces advanced into Aden from the neighboring province of Abyan, where local authorities have publicly declared support for the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen&rsquo;s internationally recognized government. Waddah al-Dubaish, spokesperson for the government-aligned Joint Forces on the western coast, said the first contingents reached the Al-Alam area, a strategic eastern gateway to the city. He added that the deployment was part of a phased security plan that would see additional brigades enter Aden in an organized and gradual manner. &ldquo;The objective is to secure the city, reinforce stability, and prevent any slide into chaos,&rdquo; Dubaish said, calling on residents to cooperate with security forces and report suspicious activity. Shrinking STC footprint The arrival of National Shield Forces in Aden follows the government&rsquo;s recent recapture of the eastern provinces of Hadhramaut and Al-Mahra, significantly narrowing the STC&rsquo;s territorial control. With authorities in Abyan, Shabwa, and Lahj siding with the government, the council&rsquo;s effective presence has been reduced to Aden, Al-Dhale, and the island of Socotra, according to Yemeni officials. The STC has long pushed for the secession of southern Yemen, arguing that successive governments have marginalized the region politically and economically. Yemeni authorities reject the claim and insist on preserving the country&rsquo;s territorial unity. The latest developments come amid Saudi-led efforts to contain the escalating crisis in Yemen. Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed Al Jaber said he met in Riyadh with an STC delegation to discuss recent moves by the council, which he described as damaging to the southern cause. In comments posted on the US social media company X, Al Jaber said the discussions focused on restoring cohesion among anti-Houthi forces and laying the groundwork for a broader dialogue on southern Yemen, including preparations for a conference expected to be held in Riyadh. Critical moment Tensions intensified further after the Saudi-led coalition said STC leader Zubaidi failed to comply with instructions to travel to Riyadh for talks, instead mobilizing forces toward Al-Dhale. Coalition spokesperson Maj. Gen. Turki Al-Maliki later said Zubaidi fled Aden by sea before leaving the region by air, a claim denied by the STC, which insists its leader continues to operate from the city. The dispute took a political turn when Yemen&rsquo;s Presidential Leadership Council announced that it had stripped Zubaidi of his membership and referred him to the public prosecutor on charges of high treason. The STC has not issued a detailed response, reiterating only that its leader remains active and rejecting the accusations. Last week, Saudi Arabia accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of pushing STC forces to carry out military operations along the kingdom&rsquo;s southern border in Hadhramaut and Mahra. Abu Dhabi denied the accusation. The confrontation marks one of the most serious rifts within Yemen&rsquo;s anti-Houthi camp in years, raising concerns over renewed instability in the south at a time when regional and international actors are pushing for de-escalation. North and South Yemen were unified on May 22, 1990, forming the Republic of Yemen. More than three decades later, the question of southern identity and governance remains one of the country&rsquo;s most volatile fault lines.

Contact lost The fast-moving crisis in Yemen has ignited a feud between the two most powerful countries in the oil-rich Gulf – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – and fractured a coalition headed by Yemen’s internationally recognised government that is fighting the Iran-backed Houthis. Matthew Bryza, an adviser to the Southern Transitional Council that the UAE backs, told Al Jazeera al-Zubaidi avoided attending talks in Riyadh because he feared being detained. “The key to de-escalate now will have to be to have a real negotiation in a neutral venue,” he said, adding the reported detention of STC members in Riyadh has further undermined prospects for substantive talks. The Saudi-led coalition said the STC delegation, excluding al-Zubaidi, departed Yemen for Riyadh in the early hours. The STC later issued a statement calling on Saudi Arabia to halt air strikes, adding ‌that they ‌lost contact ⁠with their delegation in Riyadh. Senior STC official Amr Al Beidh said Aden is still under the group’s control. ‍The STC said al-Zubaidi is in Aden and “continues his duties”. Al-Zubaidi was removed from government for “committing high treason”, said the internationally recognised Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) holding executive power. “This does not mean the victory of one party over another, and there is no room for gloating or portraying what happened as a defeat for this one or a gain for that one,” PLC Vice President Abdullah al-Alimi said in a post on X. The UAE has pursued an assertive foreign policy and carved its own sphere of influence across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy in the spotlight after its rare military escalation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen. ‘Going to be imprisoned’ Hisham al-Omeisy, a political and conflict analyst focusing on Yemen, said Saudi Arabia managed to “pull a rug” from underneath al-Zubaidi and peel away some of his key partners within the PLC, as well as some of the tribal supporters he had in Yemen. Advertisement “The Saudis kind of diluted his clout, his political leverage inside the country, and this is one of the reasons why he feared for himself. By boarding the plane, he would have felt like they already took the air out of him and that he was basically going to be imprisoned in Riyadh,” he told Al Jazeera. The STC, which initially supported Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen, launched an offensive against Saudi-backed government troops in December, seeking an independent state in the south. Their advance aimed to control broad swaths of southern Yemen, including the Hadramout and Mahra provinces, in defiance of warnings from Riyadh. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia, while Mahra is close to the border. Together, the provinces make up nearly half of Yemeni territory. Riyadh responded with air strikes on the Yemeni port of Mukalla on December 30, targeting what it called a UAE-linked weapons shipment , and backed a call by the internationally recognised government for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country. Abu Dhabi denied that the shipment contained weapons and expressed a commitment to ensure Riyadh’s security. Shortly afterwards, it announced an end to what it called its “counterterrorism mission” in Yemen. Yemeni government troops, backed by Saudi Arabian air attacks, went on to reclaim Hadramout and Mahra, and the STC said on Saturday it would attend peace talks hosted by Saudi Arabia. aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo Advertisement",

Reporting from Sanaa, journalist Yousef Mawry said the presidential palace in Aden had also been overtaken by Yemeni government forces, who also seized control of all exit and entry points to the city. Some officials from the STC, however, said the group is still in control of Aden. Mawry reported 10 government soldiers had been killed and wounded in the city of Ataq, in Shabwah province, another stronghold of the secessionist movement. Yemen’s separatist authorities imposed a night-time curfew in Aden. The 9pm to 6am (18:00 GMT to 03:00 GMT) curfew was announced by STC deputy leader Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, who is in charge of armed forces patrolling the southern city. ‘Unknown location’ In a statement, the coalition said the leader of the STC, Aidarous al-Zubaidi , was due to fly out from the Yemeni city of Aden for talks on ending the conflict between his group and the internationally recognised government of Yemen.

His current whereabouts remain unclear. “During this time, the legitimate government and the coalition received information that al-Zubaidi had mobilised a large force, including armoured and combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, as well as munitions,” the coalition said.

    "source_text": "Yemen government forces move into Aden as power balance shifts in south Middle East Yemen government forces move into Aden as power balance shifts in south Troop deployment marks new phase in confrontation with Southern Transitional Council, amid Saudi-led mediation and political fallout Mohammed Sameai and Tarek Chouiref | 08.01.2026 - Update : 09.01.2026 ISTANBUL Yemeni government-aligned forces entered the southern city of Aden on Thursday, signaling a major shift in the balance of power in the country&rsquo;s south as pressure mounts on the Southern Transitional Council (STC). The deployment comes as the government accelerates efforts to consolidate control over southern provinces, following days of military and political setbacks for the STC and amid reports that its leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, had fled the country. According to military sources aligned with Yemen&rsquo;s Presidential Leadership Council, units of the National Shield Forces advanced into Aden from the neighboring province of Abyan, where local authorities have publicly declared support for the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen&rsquo;s internationally recognized government. Waddah al-Dubaish, spokesperson for the government-aligned Joint Forces on the western coast, said the first contingents reached the Al-Alam area, a strategic eastern gateway to the city. He added that the deployment was part of a phased security plan that would see additional brigades enter Aden in an organized and gradual manner. &ldquo;The objective is to secure the city, reinforce stability, and prevent any slide into chaos,&rdquo; Dubaish said, calling on residents to cooperate with security forces and report suspicious activity. Shrinking STC footprint The arrival of National Shield Forces in Aden follows the government&rsquo;s recent recapture of the eastern provinces of Hadhramaut and Al-Mahra, significantly narrowing the STC&rsquo;s territorial control. With authorities in Abyan, Shabwa, and Lahj siding with the government, the council&rsquo;s effective presence has been reduced to Aden, Al-Dhale, and the island of Socotra, according to Yemeni officials. The STC has long pushed for the secession of southern Yemen, arguing that successive governments have marginalized the region politically and economically. Yemeni authorities reject the claim and insist on preserving the country&rsquo;s territorial unity. The latest developments come amid Saudi-led efforts to contain the escalating crisis in Yemen. Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed Al Jaber said he met in Riyadh with an STC delegation to discuss recent moves by the council, which he described as damaging to the southern cause. In comments posted on the US social media company X, Al Jaber said the discussions focused on restoring cohesion among anti-Houthi forces and laying the groundwork for a broader dialogue on southern Yemen, including preparations for a conference expected to be held in Riyadh. Critical moment Tensions intensified further after the Saudi-led coalition said STC leader Zubaidi failed to comply with instructions to travel to Riyadh for talks, instead mobilizing forces toward Al-Dhale. Coalition spokesperson Maj. Gen. Turki Al-Maliki later said Zubaidi fled Aden by sea before leaving the region by air, a claim denied by the STC, which insists its leader continues to operate from the city. The dispute took a political turn when Yemen&rsquo;s Presidential Leadership Council announced that it had stripped Zubaidi of his membership and referred him to the public prosecutor on charges of high treason. The STC has not issued a detailed response, reiterating only that its leader remains active and rejecting the accusations. Last week, Saudi Arabia accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of pushing STC forces to carry out military operations along the kingdom&rsquo;s southern border in Hadhramaut and Mahra. Abu Dhabi denied the accusation. The confrontation marks one of the most serious rifts within Yemen&rsquo;s anti-Houthi camp in years, raising concerns over renewed instability in the south at a time when regional and international actors are pushing for de-escalation. North and South Yemen were unified on May 22, 1990, forming the Republic of Yemen. More than three decades later, the question of southern identity and governance remains one of the country&rsquo;s most volatile fault lines.

The two conflicting sides, the Houthis (Zaidi Shiites) and the Salafis (conservative Sunnis), signed an agreement on Saturday, stipulating the exit of non-local Salafis from Dammaj, out of Houthi-controlled Sa&rsquo;ada. The majority of exiles were expected to resettle in Hodeida governorate, but there are many raising questions about the practicality of the relocation. Sheikh Yahia Al-Hajouri, the leader of the Salafis in Dammaj, arrived in Sana&rsquo;a on Tuesday. He, along with 100 other leading Salafi figures, were flown to the capital in four military helicopters. Al-Hajouri told the local Khabr agency that their transfer to Hodeida &ldquo;is still under discussion. Many sheikhs have refused to move to Hodeida.&rdquo; The majority of the displaced are heading to live with relatives in different areas of the country, according to local sources because there is no alternative housing in Hodeida ready to receive them. &ldquo;The displaced families have moved to different areas of Yemen. Each family went to an area in which they have relatives,&rdquo; said Soror Al-Wadei, a Salafi spokesperson in Dammaj. &ldquo;Many families have been transported out, while other families are still preparing to leave. Three-hundred buses were provided to transport the families and their belongings.&rdquo; Many described the process as disorganized and chaotic. The Salafi-operated Dar Al-Hadeeth Salafi religious school in Dammaj had a large foreign student population, which was targeted in the agreement requiring all non-locals to leave the area. &ldquo;The signed agreement cheated the Salafis,&rdquo; said Dammaj resident Mohammed Al-Wadei. Al-Wadei said Al-Hajouri and many other leading Salafi figures accompanied students from the Dar Al-Hadeeth school, who had nowhere else to go, to the Residential City in Sana&rsquo;a. Residential City was established to accommodate a Jewish minority that was evacuated from Sa&rsquo;ada due to the six wars between government forces and insurgent Houthis in the North between 2004 and 2010. Al-Wadei said he will also be leaving Dammaj, citing security concerns. Although the Salafis agreed to sign the agreement, brokered by a presidential delegation, Al-Wadei said Al-Hajouri will be meeting personally with interim President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in Sana&rsquo;a to discuss the implementation of the signed document. The agreement already appears to be facing speed bumps. Yahia Abu Osba, head of the presidential committee assigned to broker the deal in Dammaj, reported, &ldquo;Government forces have not been allowed to deploy throughout the area per the signed agreement. Forces were able to deploy in some Salafi locations, but the Houthis prevented the deployment of government forces.&rdquo; The agreement stated that the state military should take control of all locations previously used by the warring sides. However, Ali Al-Bukhaiti, a Houthi representative at the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), said, the Houthis are working to follow through with the agreement. &ldquo;There are some obstacles to the army&rsquo;s deployment in Dammaj, but we will work to overcome these obstacles,&rdquo; he said. Pro-Salafi tribes in Hajja, near Sa&rsquo;ada, had been blocking the Sa&rsquo;ada-Haradh road since November and preventing the entrance of goods and services into Sa&rsquo;ada. At the beginning of January, a deal was finally negotiated to lift the road blocks. While Salafis feel they were cheated in the agreement, Houthi NDC representative Mohammed Al-Bukhaiti, Ali Al-Bukhaiti&rsquo;s brother, said, &ldquo;We had no problem with the existence of the Salafi seminary in Dammaj. The problem was the armed fighters who were students at this school.&rdquo; While Abdulnasser Al-Khatari, the secretary general of the Rashad Union Party (the Salafi political party), says they now have to accept the signed agreement, he is not completely happy with it. He says it is a result of the state&rsquo;s inability to resolve the conflict and worries that it sets a bad precedent. &ldquo;[The survivors] had to choose between leaving or being killed, so they chose the lesser evil. We are afraid that this sectarian displacement could happen again in other parts of the country. It is worrisome that this&hellip;is based on ideology,&rdquo; he said. Related Content",

Followers of the Shi'ite Houthi group pray during a rally to denounce fuel price hikes and to demand for the resignation of the government in Sanaa August 22, 2014. RUETERS/Mohamed al-Sayaghi Related Topics World &#187; Yemen &#187; SANAA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Yemenis massed in the capital Sanaa on Friday in a protest called by the Shi'ite Houthi movement, which wants the government to reverse a decision on cutting fuel subsidies and resign. The rally came at the end of a week of demonstrations that have piled pressure on President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has struggled to keep order in the U.S.-allied country which borders major oil exporter Saudi Arabia. The Houthis have been fighting for years for more power for their Zaydi Shi'ite Muslim sect in north Yemen. Analysts say they have capitalised on anger over the subsidy cuts to bring supporters out on the streets to push to join a new government as the majority Sunni country moves towards a federal system that devolves more power to regions. Crowds gathered in a main street that leads to the airport, chanting \"the people want the fall of the government\". They set up tents near the interior, telecommunications and electricity ministries in a side street that leads to Sanaa's airport, saying they would stay until their demands were met - a move the government said \"created a threat to security\". \"In light of this dangerous escalation, the (government) security and military committee is obliged to carry out its national duties to protect the security and stability of the nation,\" the state news agency Saba said. It added that the Houthis bore responsibility for the consequences of the escalation, without elaborating. WEST, GULF CONCERNS Representatives from the Houthis and the government had met on Thursday to try to reach an agreement to defuse tensions. \"The disagreement focused on ... the Houthis' demand to set up a political party and join a new government (but) leaving out the issue of reversing a decision on fuel subsidies. The Houthis rejected that,\" a source in the government committee told Reuters on Thursday. Hadi has promised a more inclusive government after a new constitution is passed later this year. The country, which is also facing an insurgency by al Qaeda's most active wing, was plunged into turmoil after an uprising ousted Hadi's predecessor, veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh, in 2012. Western and Gulf sponsors of democratisation in Yemen are keen to engage the Houthis because they have made big gains in popular support across north Yemen since the uprising and are able to bring large numbers of people onto the streets. But, alarmed by the rise in unrest, the Group of 10 ambassadors, an informal body of Western and Gulf countries and international bodies involved in supporting political reform in Yemen, wrote to the Houthi leadership, voicing concern at recent statements it described as antagonistic and militaristic. The Gulf Cooperation Council, which brokered a deal that eased former President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, said it rejected any attempts \"aimed at undermining the political process in Yemen\" and condemned the \"unfortunate events taking place in Sanaa and the threat of using escalating measures\". Yemenis are unhappy about the government's decision to raise fuel prices in late July to cut energy subsidies to ease the burden on its budget deficit. The government spent about $3 billion on subsidies last year, nearly a third of state revenue. A previous attempt by the government to cut subsidies in 2005 led to unrest that left about 20 people dead and more than 200 wounded. The reform was cancelled.

Author Adel Moujahed al Shrhabi Posted September 29, 2014 Translator Rani Geha Original Article &#1575;&#1602;&#1585;&#1575;&#32;&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#32;&#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1589;&#1604;&#1610;&#32;&#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;&#32;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1576;&#1610;&#1577; The city of Amran &mdash; from 1963 until its fall in July 2014 at the hands of Ansar Allah (Houthi groups) &mdash; was the capital of the elders of the Hashid tribe and their military and political allies. Since 2004, the city of Saada has been the capital of Ansar Allah. Each of these cities had its own revolution. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of Yemen from 1990-2012, claims to be the rightful heir of the revolution of Sept. 26, 1962, despite having betrayed it. The al-Ahmar family and Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar claim to be the protectors of the Feb. 11, 2011, popular youth revolution. And recently, the Houthis had their own revolution (the revolution of Aug. 18, 2014), which marked the beginning of the war [which arrived to the] capital Sanaa between Sept. 16-21, 2014. In addition to the regional capitals of these elites, each elite has its &quot;mini-capitals&quot; inside Sanaa. The Houthi revolution and the general&rsquo;s coup The Ansar Allah movement organized protests after the government announced the end of fuel subsidies on July 30, 2014. The protests were described then as a popular revolution. The movement&rsquo;s leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, said the protests would escalate and end with painful acts against the authorities. This indeed happened on Sept. 16, when armed clashes broke out in northwest Sanaa between the movement&rsquo;s militias and some army units. After four days of fighting, Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar carried out what could be described as a coup attempt against President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. He moved toward the headquarters of Military Region VI (the previous First Armored Division, which Ahmar used to lead before he was dismissed and appointed adviser to the president for defense and security affairs in 2012). He did not comply with the president&#39;s and defense minister&#39;s directives and he led the battles against the Houthis himself. Gen. Ahmar did not achieve any victories, and in two days the Houthis were in control of most major government buildings in Sanaa, including the buildings of state television, state radio, the prime minister&rsquo;s office, the armed forces general command, the Ministry of Defense, the Central Bank of Yemen and Military Region VI. On the evening of Sept. 20, the UN secretary-general&#39;s envoy to Yemen announced that an agreement had been reached to resolve the current crisis in Yemen based on the results of the National Dialogue Conference. He described the agreement as &ldquo;constituting a national document that pushes forward the peaceful process of change and entrenches the principle of national partnership, security and stability in Yemen.&rdquo; A day later, an agreement was signed by two Ansar Allah representatives and one representative from each of the following: Yemeni Congregation for Reform (Islah), the General People&rsquo;s Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, the al-Rashad Party, the Justice and Construction Party, the Southern Democratic Movement, the Yemeni Unionist Gathering and the Baath Party. The agreement included a number of clauses, among them: forming a government; reducing the price of gasoline or diesel cans by 1,000 riyals; forming an economic committee to study and implement the results of the dialogue according to a timetable; and reconsidering the division of the governorates. Implementing the loathsome Islah accepted and signed the agreement under the impact of military defeat. Some Islah members don&rsquo;t want their party to participate in the next government. During the session to sign the agreement, Sheikh Muhammad al-Imam called on Islah not to participate in the government and to focus on social work among the masses. That same message was delivered by Islah figure Zaid al-Shami in a letter to members of his party. He concluded by saying, &ldquo;Come back to the fields of education, guidance and giving. Give yourselves more time for review and for internal construction.&rdquo; Moreover, the manner in which Prime Minister Muhammad Salem Basendwah (who is affiliated with Islah&rsquo;s allies) resigned supports this direction. He presented his resignation to the Yemeni people, not the president of the republic in accordance with constitutional procedures. He said in the introduction of his resignation, &ldquo;O sons of our great people, I have decided to extend to you my resignation as prime minister of the national reconciliation government. [This is] because of my great [desire] to give the opportunity for any agreement that may be reached between the brothers in the leadership of Ansar Allah and the brother Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, to be implemented as soon as possible. [I&rsquo;m leaving] so that my staying [in power] does not impede the formation of a new national government made up of the finest talent that possesses loyalty to the homeland and integrity. Perhaps they can achieve what you envisage and lead the country to safety, God willing.&rdquo; This indicates that Basendwah and the coalition he is affiliated with will look at the agreement as an accord between Ansar Allah and the president of the republic and not consider themselves a party to it, and that they are therefore not obliged to obey its clauses. Submitting his resignation to the people instead of to the president means that Basendwah doesn&rsquo;t recognize the president&rsquo;s legitimacy. This is consistent with the proposal of Sheikh Hamid al-Ahmar, who said that the dismissal of the prime minister means the end of the president&rsquo;s legitimacy. He put his position as president aside and pointed out at the end of the speech about the president unilaterally controlling power and not involving him in the preparation for the national dialogue. Winners and losers The agreement was signed after Ansar Allah achieved a sweeping military victory over its opponents. The agreement satisfied all of the group&rsquo;s conditions and earned it political gains at the local and national levels without any corresponding obligations. The sit-in camps will continue until a government is formed, but the signing of the security supplement was postponed. The movement managed to secure a commitment to reconsider the governorates&rsquo; division. This means that the group will achieve its desire to join Hajja governorate to the one it controls, which gives the group a sea outlet (Midi Port) on the Red Sea. There are also a number of clauses that ensure the group&rsquo;s participation in power with a share equal to the shares of other major political forces: appointing one of its members as adviser to the president of the republic and as members of the Shura Council, through the group&rsquo;s participation in the preparation of the new electoral record, in election monitoring, in monitoring the implementation of the results of the national dialogue and in supervising the constitution drafting committee. These political gains mean that Ansar Allah has become a potent political force equal to other political forces. The second party that benefited from this agreement is President Hadi. That&rsquo;s why the outgoing prime minister described the agreement as one between Ansar Allah and President Hadi. The agreement enhances the power and authority of President Hadi and frees him from the influence of the adviser for defense and security affairs, Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, and from Islah, who could have, with its allies, imposed many appointments on the president. Moreover, the agreement granted him the authority to choose the ministers of defense, interior, foreign affairs and finance. This frees him from pressure from the General People&rsquo;s Congress and Islah, which enjoyed the authority to appoint those ministers in accordance with the Gulf Initiative. In contrast, Gen. Ahmar, the Ahmar family and the Hashid elders are the main losers of the war and the signing of the agreement to end the crisis. All the institutions that they formed will have no political role in the coming period. This includes institutions such as the Supporters of the Revolution Committee, the National Council for the Youth Popular Revolutionary Forces and the National Solidarity Party. In fact, the fates of Gen. Ahmar, Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar and his brothers are still unknown. There is news that they left Yemen for Saudi Arabia or Qatar, or that there are arrangements to get them out of Yemen in return for their safety. This means that they are completely out of the final equation of the distribution of power in the country. There is no doubt that their exit from the political arena will adversely affect Islah&rsquo;s political influence. Islah relied on them for the past three decades and they were one of its main pillars of strength. Tactical alliances Since the beginning of the war of Amran governorate between Ansar Allah and its opponents, rumors have abounded that there is an alliance between them and former President Saleh, and that he supplied them with weapons and money, and that many tribal elders and their followers who are loyal to the former president participated in the war alongside the Houthis. There seems to be indicators that these rumors are at least partly true. But it seems that both sides got involved in this tactical alliance. Therefore Ansar Allah and the other parties who signed the agreement will not accept Saleh making any more gains from the agreement, except for achieving revenge against his political and military opponents (Islah, Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, al-Ahmar family and the elders o",

Al-Akhbar Management Yemeni security forces supporting Houthi anti-government protesters gesture during a funeral procession and an anti-government protest in Sanaa on September 12, 2014. (Photo: AFP-Mohammed Huwais) By: Ahmed al-Zarqa Published Saturday, September 20, 2014 Thursday was a pivotal night in the history of the Yemeni crisis. Sanaa fell into the hands of the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God) more than a month after they entered the city peacefully. The Houthis were able to control the north of the capital, the international airport and the air base. They also gained control of all the military and security posts along the northern entrance to the city. Sanaa – It is the beginning of a new phase marking a fundamental change in Yemen, in terms of the balance of power, the internal rules of engagement and the regional alliances in that part of the world. Sanaa is finally in the hands of the Houthis. This development came as a culmination of a long-term tactic adopted by the Houthis, who waged six wars with the Yemeni authorities before entering Sanaa peacefully with a set of demands and settling in the capital until the other side crossed certain “red lines.” The reaction of the Yemeni regime was as fiery as the event itself. Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi described what happened as a “coup attempt” while the Republican Guard were battling the Houthis only hundreds of meters away from the president’s house. Hadi apparently has not realized yet that the goal of the Houthis is not to take power because they don’t want to repeat the experience of the Brotherhood. They want to become an influential party in the internal Yemeni system until no government can rule without their consent. The rest is details that have more to do with certain regional conflicts. [Yemeni President] Hadi apparently has not realized yet that the goal of the Houthis is not to take power because they don’t want to repeat the experience of the Brotherhood. This coincided with the failure of the United Nations special envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, yesterday in convincing the leader of Ansar Allah, Abdel Malik al-Houthi, to sign a peace agreement with the Yemeni government. A source close to the mediation committee told the German news agency, Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA), that Houthi refused to sign the agreement but authorized his office director and member of the political bureau of Ansar Allah group, Mohammed al-Bakhiti, to sign it. Bakhiti told DPA that negotiations are ongoing. There has been no agreement on any step but “we cannot say the agreement has definitively failed either.” Clashes kill 40 All day yesterday, armed clashes continued in Thalatheen Street, Siteen Street, Shamlan district, the area surrounding the government-run TV building, the headquarters of the First Armored Division camp and Iman University. Presidential guards blocked the main bridge connecting Siteen Street to Mathbah after it was destroyed by a shell. The bridge is not far at all from President Hadi’s home. Armed clashes also came close to General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar’s home in the Mathbah area. Yesterday evening, Houthi rebels renewed their shelling of the government-run TV station after they had shelled it Thursday evening. The army’s Fourth Brigade, charged with protecting the radio and TV stations, responded heavily to the source of fire. Yemeni TV reported that the shelling targeted the power lines causing a power outage in the TV building, pointing out that the station is working on a small generator to continue broadcasting. A statement indicated there was significant damage to the TV station’s building and equipment, saying images of the damage will be broadcast in upcoming news bulletins. Residents of Thalateen Street and al-Khaneq in the Shamlan district appealed to the Red Cross to enter the area and pick up some of the corpses lying around as the number of casualties reached 40. They asked both sides of the conflict, the army and the Houthis, to allow a humanitarian grace period so people could either leave or stock up on food supplies. According to the news, a number of people, including children, were killed in the residential neighborhoods adjacent to the northwestern Siteen Street as a result of the shelling between both sides. The Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority announced late Thursday evening that Arab and foreign airline companies decided to suspend their flights to Sanaa. It pointed out that the duration of the suspension was set at 24 hours in light of the developments in the capital. [Residents] asked both sides of the conflict, the army and the Houthis, to allow a humanitarian grace period so people could either leave or stock up on food supplies. Immediately, the Supreme Security Committee headed by the Yemeni president, called on the Houthi rebels to withdraw from the army and security posts they seized and to show commitment to law and order, otherwise army forces will exercise their duty to protect citizens and public peace and to take deterrent measures against Houthi fighters. Ansar Allah said through its official spokesperson, Mohammed Abdel Salam, that the developments in some areas in Sanaa are “meant to protect peaceful protestors, ensure that the situation does not slip out of hand and that the bloody incidents on the Airport Street and in the vicinity of the cabinet building are not repeated and to deter ISIS-style takfiri groups that were brought in by certain centers of power to create chaos, undermine people’s faith in the victory of their revolution and divert this revolution from its just goals.” For the first time since the Houthi military escalation around the capital and in its northwestern suburb, President Hadi broke his silence accusing the rebels of a coup attempt to overthrow the government. He said, during a meeting with the ambassadors of the 10 countries that sponsored the Gulf initiative, that Houthi fighters are escalating militarily in the capital and its suburbs to blow up the situation. They targeted a number of security and military installations and tried to storm the government-run TV building. Hadi pointed out that “what happened proves that the slogans which the Houthis initially raised calling for popular demands were nothing but a smokescreen. Today, the truth about their hidden intentions was revealed.” He added: “These forces want to blow up the situation and this is what we tried to avoid time and again because we realized the risks and economic repercussions for the country and the deep impact on social peace.” Bakhiti told Al-Akhbar that there are no new developments in the negotiations between Ansar Allah and the UN special envoy to Yemen Benomar. He stressed: “It seems we have not reached a final agreement yet.” Commenting on the Houthi’s military escalation in Sanaa, Bakhiti said that the demands of the group were clear and out in the open. Besides, we declared that “killing protesters is a red line. But the government with its stupidity did not respond to these demands.” He added that what is happening now is fighting between the Muslim Brotherhood and the bloody terrorist groups affiliated with it on one hand and Ansar Allah on the other. He pointed out that the fighting in the Shamlan district “broke out after members of al-Islah Party stormed more than 30 houses in Shamlan and arrested their owners under the pretext that they are spying for us.” In response to Hadi’s speech, Bakhiti accused parties within the government of trying to derail the negotiations as the presidency has failed to respond to the people’s demands. In response to Hadi’s speech, [Houthi office director] Bakhiti accused parties within the government of trying to derail the negotiations as the presidency has failed to respond to the people’s demands. In his view, the president’s decision to change two members of the negotiations committee, Dr. Abdel Karim al-Eryani and Abdel Qader Hilal, after reaching a final agreement to end the crisis is evidence of the growing influence and impact of the camp around President Hadi impeding a political settlement. After three days of talks held between the UN special envoy and Houthi in northern Yemen’s Saada province, Benomar returned to Sanaa without signing an agreement to end the crisis. Benomar expressed his deep regret for the deterioration of the situation in Sanaa to the point of using weapons as efforts are ongoing to reach a peaceful solution to the crisis. He stressed the need to stop all acts of violence immediately and for everyone to act wisely. Benomar said upon his return to Sanaa from Saada province yesterday evening that talks were conducted with Houthi in the past couple of days. The first round lasted three hours on Wednesday and the second round on Thursday lasted about seven hours until the late hour of the night. He added: “We tried to bridge the gap between all the parties and we agreed on a host of issues that could create a foundation for an agreement based on the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference. He called for an immediate end to all acts of violence, hoping that all the parties would act wisely in a way that would serve the country’s higher interests. The National Alignment urges a call to arms The National Alignment body in Yemen asked President Hadi to “declare a call to arms and open the door to recruitment to protect Sanna.” The body called in a statement yesterday on the Yemeni president to “exercise his constitutional and legal responsibility to protect citizens and their private and public property.” They asked him to “quickly support the military forces by declaring a call to arms, opening voluntary recruitment to protect the capital Sanaa and its residents, lift the armed siege of the capital and end the public carrying of arms and everything that disturbs citizens’ public tranquility.” The statement stressed the need to “extend national authority and sovereignty on all Yemeni soil, especially in the provinces of Saada and Omran al-Jawf in the north.” The statement also called for “bringing the displaced and the refugees back to their homes and compensating them fairly for the damages they sustained, implementing the National Dialogue Conference outcomes, announcing a timetable for implementing these outcomes and forming a national unity government based on standards of competence and integrity.” (Anado",

The source expected the death toll to rise as scores were injured in the deadly violence. The clashes had broken out on Friday in the Shamlan district in northern Sanaa, in close proximity to the residence of the Yemeni president. Houthi militants also attacked the state television headquarters in the same area. The Houthi group, for its part, claimed that Houthi protesters had come under fire, prompting them to fire back. The violence comes amid massive Houthi protests to demand the dismissal of Prime Minister Mohamed Basindawa&#39;s government, along with the reversal of a recent government decision to slash fuel subsidies. Demonstrations turned deadly earlier this month after protesters camped outside government buildings and blocked key roads in the capital. President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi recently offered to sack the government, inviting the Houthis to take part in the formation of a unity government. He also offered to reduce fuel prices. According to Hadi&#39;s proposal, however, the president would retain the right to directly appoint the ministers of \"strategic\" government portfolios (interior, defense and foreign affairs). The Houthis, however, rejected Hadi&#39;s offer and vowed to escalate protests further. Yemen has been dogged by unrest since a popular uprising that began in 2011 ousted longstanding president Ali Abdullah Saleh one year later.

Author Adel Moujahed al Shrhabi Posted September 29, 2014 Translator Rani Geha Original Article &#1575;&#1602;&#1585;&#1575;&#32;&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#32;&#1575;&#1604;&#1571;&#1589;&#1604;&#1610;&#32;&#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;&#32;&#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1576;&#1610;&#1577; The city of Amran &mdash; from 1963 until its fall in July 2014 at the hands of Ansar Allah (Houthi groups) &mdash; was the capital of the elders of the Hashid tribe and their military and political allies. Since 2004, the city of Saada has been the capital of Ansar Allah. Each of these cities had its own revolution. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of Yemen from 1990-2012, claims to be the rightful heir of the revolution of Sept. 26, 1962, despite having betrayed it. The al-Ahmar family and Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar claim to be the protectors of the Feb. 11, 2011, popular youth revolution. And recently, the Houthis had their own revolution (the revolution of Aug. 18, 2014), which marked the beginning of the war [which arrived to the] capital Sanaa between Sept. 16-21, 2014. In addition to the regional capitals of these elites, each elite has its &quot;mini-capitals&quot; inside Sanaa. The Houthi revolution and the general&rsquo;s coup The Ansar Allah movement organized protests after the government announced the end of fuel subsidies on July 30, 2014. The protests were described then as a popular revolution. The movement&rsquo;s leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, said the protests would escalate and end with painful acts against the authorities. This indeed happened on Sept. 16, when armed clashes broke out in northwest Sanaa between the movement&rsquo;s militias and some army units. After four days of fighting, Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar carried out what could be described as a coup attempt against President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. He moved toward the headquarters of Military Region VI (the previous First Armored Division, which Ahmar used to lead before he was dismissed and appointed adviser to the president for defense and security affairs in 2012). He did not comply with the president&#39;s and defense minister&#39;s directives and he led the battles against the Houthis himself. Gen. Ahmar did not achieve any victories, and in two days the Houthis were in control of most major government buildings in Sanaa, including the buildings of state television, state radio, the prime minister&rsquo;s office, the armed forces general command, the Ministry of Defense, the Central Bank of Yemen and Military Region VI. On the evening of Sept. 20, the UN secretary-general&#39;s envoy to Yemen announced that an agreement had been reached to resolve the current crisis in Yemen based on the results of the National Dialogue Conference. He described the agreement as &ldquo;constituting a national document that pushes forward the peaceful process of change and entrenches the principle of national partnership, security and stability in Yemen.&rdquo; A day later, an agreement was signed by two Ansar Allah representatives and one representative from each of the following: Yemeni Congregation for Reform (Islah), the General People&rsquo;s Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, the al-Rashad Party, the Justice and Construction Party, the Southern Democratic Movement, the Yemeni Unionist Gathering and the Baath Party. The agreement included a number of clauses, among them: forming a government; reducing the price of gasoline or diesel cans by 1,000 riyals; forming an economic committee to study and implement the results of the dialogue according to a timetable; and reconsidering the division of the governorates. Implementing the loathsome Islah accepted and signed the agreement under the impact of military defeat. Some Islah members don&rsquo;t want their party to participate in the next government. During the session to sign the agreement, Sheikh Muhammad al-Imam called on Islah not to participate in the government and to focus on social work among the masses. That same message was delivered by Islah figure Zaid al-Shami in a letter to members of his party. He concluded by saying, &ldquo;Come back to the fields of education, guidance and giving. Give yourselves more time for review and for internal construction.&rdquo; Moreover, the manner in which Prime Minister Muhammad Salem Basendwah (who is affiliated with Islah&rsquo;s allies) resigned supports this direction. He presented his resignation to the Yemeni people, not the president of the republic in accordance with constitutional procedures. He said in the introduction of his resignation, &ldquo;O sons of our great people, I have decided to extend to you my resignation as prime minister of the national reconciliation government. [This is] because of my great [desire] to give the opportunity for any agreement that may be reached between the brothers in the leadership of Ansar Allah and the brother Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, to be implemented as soon as possible. [I&rsquo;m leaving] so that my staying [in power] does not impede the formation of a new national government made up of the finest talent that possesses loyalty to the homeland and integrity. Perhaps they can achieve what you envisage and lead the country to safety, God willing.&rdquo; This indicates that Basendwah and the coalition he is affiliated with will look at the agreement as an accord between Ansar Allah and the president of the republic and not consider themselves a party to it, and that they are therefore not obliged to obey its clauses. Submitting his resignation to the people instead of to the president means that Basendwah doesn&rsquo;t recognize the president&rsquo;s legitimacy. This is consistent with the proposal of Sheikh Hamid al-Ahmar, who said that the dismissal of the prime minister means the end of the president&rsquo;s legitimacy. He put his position as president aside and pointed out at the end of the speech about the president unilaterally controlling power and not involving him in the preparation for the national dialogue. Winners and losers The agreement was signed after Ansar Allah achieved a sweeping military victory over its opponents. The agreement satisfied all of the group&rsquo;s conditions and earned it political gains at the local and national levels without any corresponding obligations. The sit-in camps will continue until a government is formed, but the signing of the security supplement was postponed. The movement managed to secure a commitment to reconsider the governorates&rsquo; division. This means that the group will achieve its desire to join Hajja governorate to the one it controls, which gives the group a sea outlet (Midi Port) on the Red Sea. There are also a number of clauses that ensure the group&rsquo;s participation in power with a share equal to the shares of other major political forces: appointing one of its members as adviser to the president of the republic and as members of the Shura Council, through the group&rsquo;s participation in the preparation of the new electoral record, in election monitoring, in monitoring the implementation of the results of the national dialogue and in supervising the constitution drafting committee. These political gains mean that Ansar Allah has become a potent political force equal to other political forces. The second party that benefited from this agreement is President Hadi. That&rsquo;s why the outgoing prime minister described the agreement as one between Ansar Allah and President Hadi. The agreement enhances the power and authority of President Hadi and frees him from the influence of the adviser for defense and security affairs, Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, and from Islah, who could have, with its allies, imposed many appointments on the president. Moreover, the agreement granted him the authority to choose the ministers of defense, interior, foreign affairs and finance. This frees him from pressure from the General People&rsquo;s Congress and Islah, which enjoyed the authority to appoint those ministers in accordance with the Gulf Initiative. In contrast, Gen. Ahmar, the Ahmar family and the Hashid elders are the main losers of the war and the signing of the agreement to end the crisis. All the institutions that they formed will have no political role in the coming period. This includes institutions such as the Supporters of the Revolution Committee, the National Council for the Youth Popular Revolutionary Forces and the National Solidarity Party. In fact, the fates of Gen. Ahmar, Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar and his brothers are still unknown. There is news that they left Yemen for Saudi Arabia or Qatar, or that there are arrangements to get them out of Yemen in return for their safety. This means that they are completely out of the final equation of the distribution of power in the country. There is no doubt that their exit from the political arena will adversely affect Islah&rsquo;s political influence. Islah relied on them for the past three decades and they were one of its main pillars of strength. Tactical alliances Since the beginning of the war of Amran governorate between Ansar Allah and its opponents, rumors have abounded that there is an alliance between them and former President Saleh, and that he supplied them with weapons and money, and that many tribal elders and their followers who are loyal to the former president participated in the war alongside the Houthis. There seems to be indicators that these rumors are at least partly true. But it seems that both sides got involved in this tactical alliance. Therefore Ansar Allah and the other parties who signed the agreement will not accept Saleh making any more gains from the agreement, except for achieving revenge against his political and military opponents (Islah, Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, al-Ahmar family and the elders o",

Many people here thought that if a small village called Dammaj in northern Yemen resisted the Houthi raids for months, the heavily fortified capital would have been able to fight back for years. It took northern Yemen Shiite rebels a couple of days to take over key government buildings and military buildings . \"I could not believe my eyes or ears,\" said Yahyia al-Warafi, an owner of a small grocery in the city of Ibb, southern Sanaa, told Middle East Eye. \"But I was happy because there was not much bloodshed in Sanaa.\" The Yemeni capital was pronounced as being under control of the Houthi rebels on Sunday - nearly a month after the beginning of their massive rallies in the capital. Initially, the Houthis mounted the protests to call for the resignation of the government, termination of fuel price decisions and implementation of transitional talks. The protesters blocked roads and camped out in the streets and outskirts of the capital. Ineffective forces For any person who has a strong grasp on the country, the situation is mind-boggling. Many observers here said that even if the army did not protect the capital, the remaining troops under the command of Ali Mohsen al-Ahmer and the militias loyal to the other powerful tribal leaders of Ahmer tribe would do so. Ali Mohsen Ahmer, a former powerful army general, was a pillar of the government of the former president Ali Abdulla Saleh before defecting and joining opposition in 2011 . This defection heralded a turning point in the anti-Saleh uprising and boosted many other generals to follow suit. Ahmer used to have thousands of troops under his command and Saleh assigned him to handle the six sporadic wars with the Houthis. Just this week, his loyalists briefly fought the Houthis before surrendering. Sadeq Ahmer and his brothers were the other powerful forces in the country that were supposed to repel Houthi raids. Sadeq is the head of the most influential and populous tribe in Yemen, Hashed . His brother Hamed is an oil and telecommunications tycoon and his money was the lifeline for anti-Saleh protests. These forces collectively challenged the former president when he was at the highest of his power but could resist the attacks by some armed militiamen on Sunday. \"They [the Houthis] attacked Ali Mohsen's forces with light and medium weapons and from zones controlled by al-Ahmer,\" a senior security officer told MEE on condition of anonymity. Some people even wondered why the radical Sunni al-Qaeda militants did not clash with the Houthis as some local media outlets reported that al-Qaeda militants had infiltrated the capital before the fall of Sanaa. Looting Shortly after tightening their grip on the capital, the Houthis began storming houses of their long-standing opponents, such as some figures affiliated with the Islamist Islah party. Armed men broke into the houses and looted the belongings of their opponents, including the home of Nobel Peace Laureate, Tawakul Karman, former minister of information, the minister of education and others, according to witnesses and owners of the houses. Some the rebels boasted about their actions by posting photos, the authenticity of which was not immediately verifiable, in the looted bedrooms to Facebook. To make amends, some Houthis have admitted to their fighters' mistakes and tried to appease people's anger , Ali al-Bikhiti, a spokesperson for the group, had to crisscross the capital, visiting the looted houses and offering apologies to their owners on the behalf of the Houthi leader. The Houthis also distributed their mobile numbers and asked people to call them if any of their supporters broke into houses. Houthi activists posted photos on social media of their children playing in the yard of Ali Mohsen's mansion. Surprisingly, the Houthis did not approach the houses of the former president or any of his close relatives or aides in the capital. Mr. Saleh spearheaded six sporadic wars against the Houthis and killed their leader Hussein Al Houthi in 2004. Prediction Some analysts like Yasser Al-Yafae, the editor of the weekly Yafa'a News newspaper, think that the collapse of Amran province was the first tell-tale sign of Sanaa capture by the Houthis. Amran province has long been the stronghold of al-Ahmer tribes. \"What happened in Sanaa was predictable, especially after the fall of Amran province which represents the tribal and military dimension for Islah party,\" Yafae told MEE. Yafae said army allegiances shifted between the rival forces that faced off in 2011. \"The Yemen army loyalties are divided between the Islah that fought Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh who aided them to control Sanaa.\" The security official said that there are many collective reasons that led to the unexpected collapse of the security forces. The other reason was recent military reshuffling, said the official, that dismantled the elite republican guard and alienated some of its qualified commanders. \"I think of those soldiers who were disgusted by the new government's methods and began making overtures with the Houthis.\" The republican guard used to be commanded by the son of the former president, Ahmad Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Hadi removed him and many other relatives of the former president to loosen Saleh's grip on the army. Human cost The Houthi incursions in the capital claimed the lives of many people. The Ministry of Health said on Tuesday that emergency teams in the capital retrieved the bodies of 200 people were killed and 461 rescued from clashes between the Houthis and the army . At the beginning of Houthi rallies on 18 August, dozens of army soldiers and Houthi supporters died in fierce clashes between the two sides on the outskirts of the capital. Denial Yemen President, Abd Rabbu Mansour, on Tuesday refused to admit that the capital had fallen in the hands of the Houthis, despite the deployment of rebel fighters in each corner of the capital. \"Sanaa did not and will not fall.\" Hadi attributed the failure of army and security forces to protect the capital against the Houthi assaults to an \"unimaginable conspiracy\" by some figures that \"lost\" their interest or wanting to settle scores with opponents. \"We were stabbed and betrayed,\" Hadi said in a televised speech. \"I promise you that I will do all my efforts and procedures to restore the state's dignity, its institutes and protect citizens. The coming days will be better and things will improve.\" Despite agreeing that the Houthis have improved security in the country's most restive province, al-Warafi said that the Houthis could not make economic prosperity in their strongholds.\"Houthis are not capable of governing a country.

Many people here thought that if a small village called Dammaj in northern Yemen resisted the Houthi raids for months, the heavily fortified capital would have been able to fight back for years. It took northern Yemen Shiite rebels a couple of days to take over key government buildings and military buildings . \"I could not believe my eyes or ears,\" said Yahyia al-Warafi, an owner of a small grocery in the city of Ibb, southern Sanaa, told Middle East Eye. \"But I was happy because there was not much bloodshed in Sanaa.\" The Yemeni capital was pronounced as being under control of the Houthi rebels on Sunday - nearly a month after the beginning of their massive rallies in the capital. Initially, the Houthis mounted the protests to call for the resignation of the government, termination of fuel price decisions and implementation of transitional talks. The protesters blocked roads and camped out in the streets and outskirts of the capital. Ineffective forces For any person who has a strong grasp on the country, the situation is mind-boggling. Many observers here said that even if the army did not protect the capital, the remaining troops under the command of Ali Mohsen al-Ahmer and the militias loyal to the other powerful tribal leaders of Ahmer tribe would do so. Ali Mohsen Ahmer, a former powerful army general, was a pillar of the government of the former president Ali Abdulla Saleh before defecting and joining opposition in 2011 . This defection heralded a turning point in the anti-Saleh uprising and boosted many other generals to follow suit. Ahmer used to have thousands of troops under his command and Saleh assigned him to handle the six sporadic wars with the Houthis. Just this week, his loyalists briefly fought the Houthis before surrendering. Sadeq Ahmer and his brothers were the other powerful forces in the country that were supposed to repel Houthi raids. Sadeq is the head of the most influential and populous tribe in Yemen, Hashed . His brother Hamed is an oil and telecommunications tycoon and his money was the lifeline for anti-Saleh protests. These forces collectively challenged the former president when he was at the highest of his power but could resist the attacks by some armed militiamen on Sunday. \"They [the Houthis] attacked Ali Mohsen's forces with light and medium weapons and from zones controlled by al-Ahmer,\" a senior security officer told MEE on condition of anonymity. Some people even wondered why the radical Sunni al-Qaeda militants did not clash with the Houthis as some local media outlets reported that al-Qaeda militants had infiltrated the capital before the fall of Sanaa. Looting Shortly after tightening their grip on the capital, the Houthis began storming houses of their long-standing opponents, such as some figures affiliated with the Islamist Islah party. Armed men broke into the houses and looted the belongings of their opponents, including the home of Nobel Peace Laureate, Tawakul Karman, former minister of information, the minister of education and others, according to witnesses and owners of the houses. Some the rebels boasted about their actions by posting photos, the authenticity of which was not immediately verifiable, in the looted bedrooms to Facebook. To make amends, some Houthis have admitted to their fighters' mistakes and tried to appease people's anger , Ali al-Bikhiti, a spokesperson for the group, had to crisscross the capital, visiting the looted houses and offering apologies to their owners on the behalf of the Houthi leader. The Houthis also distributed their mobile numbers and asked people to call them if any of their supporters broke into houses. Houthi activists posted photos on social media of their children playing in the yard of Ali Mohsen's mansion. Surprisingly, the Houthis did not approach the houses of the former president or any of his close relatives or aides in the capital. Mr. Saleh spearheaded six sporadic wars against the Houthis and killed their leader Hussein Al Houthi in 2004. Prediction Some analysts like Yasser Al-Yafae, the editor of the weekly Yafa'a News newspaper, think that the collapse of Amran province was the first tell-tale sign of Sanaa capture by the Houthis. Amran province has long been the stronghold of al-Ahmer tribes. \"What happened in Sanaa was predictable, especially after the fall of Amran province which represents the tribal and military dimension for Islah party,\" Yafae told MEE. Yafae said army allegiances shifted between the rival forces that faced off in 2011. \"The Yemen army loyalties are divided between the Islah that fought Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh who aided them to control Sanaa.\" The security official said that there are many collective reasons that led to the unexpected collapse of the security forces. The other reason was recent military reshuffling, said the official, that dismantled the elite republican guard and alienated some of its qualified commanders. \"I think of those soldiers who were disgusted by the new government's methods and began making overtures with the Houthis.\" The republican guard used to be commanded by the son of the former president, Ahmad Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Hadi removed him and many other relatives of the former president to loosen Saleh's grip on the army.

Al-Akhbar Management Yemeni security forces supporting Shiite Huthi anti-government protesters gesture during an anti-government protest in Sanaa on September 12, 2014. (Photo: AFP-Mohammed Huwais) By: Ahmed al-Zarqa Published Monday, September 22, 2014 The world will wake today to a new Yemen, whose political features have radically changed after the Houthis managed to abort the configuration set up by the Gulf states together with the US following the resignation of [former President] Ali Abdullah Saleh. The new configuration sees the Qatari-Turkish influence diminished, through the deadly blow dealt to the Muslim “Brothers” in Yemen. The agreement was preceded by a complete shift in the balance of power in favor of the Houthis, who were able to take control of the heart of the Yemeni capital. Sanaa – September 21, 2014 will no doubt be a historical day, the day the Houthis controlled all the levers of the Yemeni regime but without seizing power. The Houthis also succeeded in dealing a deadly blow to the Muslim “Brothers” in Yemen, represented by its two symbols Ali Mohsen al-Ahmed and Abdel Majid al-Zindani, and with them, the Qatari-Turkish influence in the country, yet without antagonizing Saudi Arabia, which seems to be resigned to the emerging shift in the balance of power in Sanaa. At least, this is what the meeting between Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif suggests, as the Yemeni regime was being routed at the hands of Ansar Allah, the Houthis’ umbrella group. The meeting itself and its timing are extremely significant, as well as the statements made afterwards by the two ministers. Zarif said, “Iran and Saudi Arabia are two neighboring countries that are extremely important in the region. We need to work together to start a new chapter in our relationship, which we hope will serve peace, security, and the interests of the Islamic nation.” This diplomatic “salute” was seized upon by al-Faisal, who responded even more cordially. He said, “Our two countries sense the seriousness of the moment and what the opportunity allows us to do in this crisis. We are convinced of the need to seize the opportunity and avoid the mistakes of the past. I hope we succeed because the two countries are part of the region, and their cooperation would be for the good of the region and the international community. Next time, we will meet in Saudi Arabia.” The cordial tone emphasized cooperation and the need to avoid mistakes then, coupled with an invitation for a future meeting in Saudi Arabia, even as the Ansar Allah forces were toppling the institutions of power in Yemen one after the other. “Peace and national partnership” agreement Regardless of what this means, the developments on the ground precipitated an agreement between the Yemeni government and Ansar Allah brokered by the UN envoy to Yemen Jamal Benomar. The “peace and national partnership” agreement, which the Houthis signed on Sunday evening, stipulated the formation of a technocratic government in the next few months, the reduction of fuel prices by half of the hike implemented since the end of July, and the appointment of two advisers to the president representing the Houthis and the Southern Movement, in addition to the creation of an economic committee a week after the government is formed, in return for a ceasefire and an end to the Houthi-led protests. ”The Popular Committees declare having completely purged the headquarters of the disbanded 1st division, and that Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar is wanted for justice.” – Ansar Allah spokesperson According to the Turkish Anatolia news agency, the Houthis refused to sign the “security appendix” to the agreement, which contains 17 clauses requiring the Houthis to: hand over the government institutions they had seized back to the government, withdraw their fighters from Sanaa and the province of Imran; end their armed manifestations and remove protest camps from the capital; and implement the recommendations of the National Dialogue regarding disarmament of all sides. According to sources in the Yemeni presidency and government, the Nasserist Unionist People's Organization and the Salafi Rashad Union Party refused to sign the agreement after the Houthis rejected the security appendix. The agreement was preceded by a complete shift in the balance of power in favor of the Houthis, who were able to take control of the heart of the Yemeni capital and seize the headquarters of the government, the Ministry of Defense, and the army’s general command, in addition to a number of ministries, the state radio and television building, and the central bank, after the army forces tasked with protecting them retreated following orders not to engage the Houthi militants. The quick collapse of sovereign and military institutions in Sanaa following the Houthi offensive surprised many observers. It also demonstrates that there could be a long-term plan involving multiple parties. Indeed, it seems that the decision of the Yemeni government to lift subsidies on fuel was the signal propelling the decision to seize Sanaa amid the disintegration of the ruling elites and their corruption. In this context, Ali-Bukhaiti, member of the political council of Ansar Allah, said that the group’s fighters deployed around the prime minister’s office and the radio, and took over the two buildings, without any resistance from the army forces charged with protecting them. In conjunction with the Houthi takeover of the government and security institutions, the head of the government of national reconciliation Mohammed Salem Basendwah submitted his resignation, claiming that this was to “give an opportunity for an agreement between President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi and the Houthi group.” Following his resignation, Basendwah made a statement in which he complained about having been marginalized by the Yemeni president, who he said had robbed him of his powers and did not involve him in security, military, and diplomatic affairs. Militarily, the official spokesperson for Ansar Allah Mohammed Abdel Salam declared that the group’s fighters had seized the headquarters of the 1st armored division, led by Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who seems to have managed to escape, after fierce fighting that lasted for about 24 hours, in which light to heavy weapons were used, claiming the lives of dozens on both sides. Abdel Salam said, “The Popular Committees declare having completely purged the headquarters of the disbanded 1st division, and that Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar is wanted for justice.” Meanwhile, scores of students and faculty fled al-Iman University, which is affiliated to the leader of the Islah Party Abdel Majeed al-Zindani, after the Supreme Security Committee told them it was unable to protect them from the Houthi gunmen besieging its campus for the last three days. The university was shelled, and flames were seen rising from the campus on al-Sitten Street. The militants also seized all offices of the Islah Party in the north of the capital, while the Science and Technology Hospital affiliated to al-Islah leaders was evacuated from all patients and staff at the request of Houthi fighters. On his Facebook page, Abdel Salam declared that all official buildings were in the hands of his group. He wrote, “Military and security authorities that ‘supported the popular revolt and sided with the people’ are the General Command of the Armed Forces, the Radio and Television Complex, and the official institutions in the Tahrir area and the prime minister’s office.” In a move that reflects how much control the Houthis have on the ground, the Minister of Interior Major General Abdo Hussein al-Tareb asked all employees of the ministry to avoid friction with Ansar Allah, and to cooperate with them to impose order and preserve public and government properties, which he said belonged to the whole people, deeming Ansar Allah “friends of the police” for the sake of the public interest of the homeland. The agreement concluded on Sunday night puts an end to a month-long crisis, which had erupted after the Yemeni government decided to lift subsidies on fuel. Afterwards, thousands of Yemenis took to the streets in demonstrations organized by Ansar Allah in Sanaa, as the Houthis erected sit-in camps along the capital’s entrances, making a set of demands, including the resignation of the government, reversing the decision to end fuel subsidies, and implementing the National Dialogue recommendations. However, the Houthi protest movement escalated at the instructions of the group’s leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi. In recent weeks, the crisis reached boiling point more than once, before the militants finally raided the capital and took over government buildings. The end of the role of Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar [T]housands of Yemenis took to the streets in demonstrations organized by Ansar Allah in Sanaa, as the Houthis erected sit-in camps along the capital’s entrances. The role of Ali Mohsen al-Ahmed has come to an end. What has been a dream for a broad segment of the Yemenis became reality on Sunday, after the leader of the northwestern military region and the 1st Armored Division fled from his headquarters, when Ansar Allah prevailed in the military confrontations on Sunday. A video recording posted by a social media activist showed a number of cars and military crews passing through a street in Sanaa at great speed, reportedly the convoy of Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar after the Houthis took over his headquarters. Ahmed (born on June 20, 1945), who joined the Yemeni army in 1961, was a strongman who served the Yemeni regime beginning with the tenure of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. In 1978, he thwarted a military coup staged by the Nasserist Party. He was the regime’s number one man in Yemen, and Saleh relied on him as the man of difficult missions, before he defected following the revolution of 2011.

Reuters/Khaled Abdullah left 2 of 2 right SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen's Shi'ite Muslim rebels signed an agreement with other political parties on Sunday to form a more inclusive government after rebels advanced on major state institutions in the capital Sanaa, largely unopposed by troops and security forces. The accord aims to address a decade-old Shi'ite Houthi insurgency and a spate of bloodshed this month that posed a major threat to U.N.-backed efforts to stabilise the country, which neighbours oil giant Saudi Arabia and has also struggled to contain al Qaeda militants and southern secessionists. Hours before the signing ceremony Prime Minister Mohammed Basindwa submitted his resignation to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, saying he hoped the move would help consensus emerge from the accord. His resignation added to the uncertainty in Sanaa, where more than 100 people have been killed in four days of clashes between the Houthis and troops loyal to an army general they have long accused of following a militant Islamist views that brand Shi'ites as heretics. Sanaa residents said Houthis had taken over several government sites including the prime minister's buildings, an army command centre and the state television compound after security forces withdrew - although TV broadcasts continued. After the accord was signed, state news agency Saba said that military police have begun taking back government buildings seized by the Houthis, though it was unclear how much control the rebels were prepared to cede. Witnesses at the ceremony said the Houthi representatives, who flew to Sanaa on a special flight from Saada, some 540 km (330 miles) to the north, refused to sign an annex to the accord which calls for the state to take control of areas seized by the Houthis and to return weapons captured during the fighting. Other factions who signed the accord, overseen by Hadi at the presidential palace, included a wing of the southern separatist Herak group and the Islamist Islah party. The accord calls for the creation of a new national unity government within one month which will bring in the Houthis and mostly reverse an unpopular decision to increase fuel prices. CEASEFIRE Despite the refusal of the Houthis -- and the small Nasserite party -- to sign the annex, Hadi immediately declared a ceasefire. \"I call on all parties to work together to implement the terms of this agreement from this moment,\" he said in a televised speech. The Yemeni government press office said that as well as demanding an immediate ceasefire and an end to all violence, the accord \"calls for the formation of a technocrat national government which will work to enhance government transparency, implement economic reforms, in addition to continuing military and security reforms.\" There was no immediate comment from Hadi's office about Basindwa's resignation but U.N. special envoy Jamal Benomar, who mediated the agreement, said Basindwa's administration will remain as a caretaker government until a new cabinet is formed. Basindwa took office as head of a national unity government in 2011 under a Gulf-brokered deal that eventually led to veteran president Ali Abdullah Saleh stepping aside in the wake of prolonged protest against his three decades in office. The Houthis, who stayed out of Basindwa's government, have pressed for a new administration. Last month, they began a wave of demonstrations in Sanaa to protest against the raise in fuel prices, a move that had been taken to curb the rising budget deficit. The protests later escalated into armed clashes. The group, whose ultimate goal is to restore the Zaydi imamate that was toppled in a 1962 coup, has fought several battles with the central government under Saleh's rule before a ceasefire took hold in 2010. ADVANCE The fighting in Sanaa threatens the U.N.-backed transition to democracy that began after Saleh stepped down in 2012. The clashes had largely been concentrated in the north of the city near the headquarters of the First Armoured Division, a force loyal to General Ali Mohsen. Houthi rebels on Sunday captured the Division's headquarters and an adjacent religious university run by a Sunni Muslim seen as another enemy of the group that hails from the Zaydi branch of Shi'ite Islam. Students and security guards at the university run by Abdel-Majeed al-Zindani, a prominent cleric who is on a U.S. terrorism blacklist, were later forced to quit the campus due to the Houthi attacks, a university official told Reuters on Sunday. The rebels had earlier beaten back a military force stationed to protect the state television station. The Interior Ministry's website said the minister had instructed security forces to avoid clashing with the Houthis, but one resident said on Sunday he had counted at least 10 bodies -- six Houthi fighters and four uniformed soldiers -- killed in the fighting. Fighting raged throughout Saturday on the outskirts of Sanaa and the rebels said they had taken control of the headquarters of state television, though broadcasting continued from a different location. Yemen's Higher Security Committee announced a curfew in four areas of the capital from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m. and schools have been shut until further notice.

A decree appointed Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak to the post, but rebels said the matter was &quot;under consultation&quot;. Last month, the Houthis signed an agreement with Mr Hadi to try to end a political crisis that saw some of the worst violence for years in Sanaa. The president reversed unpopular fuel subsidy cuts and gave the rebels a say in the formation of a new government. It was hoped that by naming prime minister acceptable to the Houthis, its fighters could be persuaded to leave the capital. Image source, AFP Image caption, Armed Houthi rebels took over key buildings in Sanaa last month The presidential decree was issued after meetings between Mr Hadi and several advisers, including representatives of the rebels. The official Saba news agency claimed that Mr Mubarak&#x27;s appointment was met with agreement from all parties. However, rebel spokesman Abdul Malik al-Ijri said that his group did not agree with the appointment and that consultation on a new prime minister was still ongoing. The fighting in Sanaa last month, which came after weeks of protests and clashes, threatened to derail the UN-backed transition to democracy launched after President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down in 2011. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), have staged periodic uprisings since 2004 to win greater autonomy for their northern heartland of Saada province.

The Shia rebels agreed on Wednesday to withdraw from areas overlooking the presidential palace and the private compound of the President, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, after receiving assurances of constitutional change and power-sharing. In a statement issued late on Wednesday, Hadi said the Houthis had a right to serve in posts in all state institutions, and a draft constitution that had been a source of disagreement between him and the group was open to amendment. He said the Houthis agreed to withdraw fighters from areas overlooking his palace, his private home and the official residence of the prime minister, as well as a missile base, and had promised to immediately free his chief of staff, whom they had held captive since Saturday. “The draft constitution is subject to amendments, deletions, streamlining and additions,” said the statement. All sides agreed government and state institutions, schools and universities should rapidly return to work, it added. A source close to Hadi said the president met an official from the armed group, and denied reports the head of state was under house arrest, despite two days of pitched battles outside his home. After clashes erupted at the president’s office and home on Tuesday, the Houthi leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, had threatened to take further “measures” unless Hadi bowed to his demand for constitutional changes that would increase Houthi power. Advertisement The Houthis, an ally of Iran, swept into the capital four months ago and have emerged as the dominant force in the country. For now at least they appear to have decided to stop short of overthrowing Hadi, possibly preferring to exert control over a weakened leader rather than take on the burden of power. ‘President free to leave home’ “President Hadi is still in his home. There is no problem, he can leave,” Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi politburo, told Reuters. Houthis take over Yemen presidential palace Prime Minister Khaled Bahah quit his official residence, which had also been surrounded by Houthi fighters, for “a safe place after three days of siege”, one of his aides told the Reuters news agency. Yemeni military sources said the Houthis also seized the military aviation college close to Hadi’s home, and the main missile base in Sanaa, without a fight. In the south of the country, Hadi’s home region, local officials denounced what they called a coup against him. They shut the air and sea ports of the south’s main city, Aden, and closed land entry routes. Gulf Arab states, which support Hadi and oppose Iranian influence in the region, denounced what they called “terrorist” acts by the Houthis and their allies. ‘Master of mischief’ The Houthis managed to rise to power after the country plunged into a state of turmoil following the ousting of Yemen’s leader Ali Abdullah Saleh. In a separate incident that has sparked further controversy involving Saleh, leaked telephone conversations have shown that Saleh was talking with Houthi rebels a month after the Shia group took control of capital Sanaa. In the audio recording, received by Al Jazeera on Wednesday, Saleh is heard apparently coordinating military and political moves with Abdul Wahid Abu Ras, a Houthi leader. The audio was reportedly recorded in October. Speaking to Al Jazeera from London, Mohamed Qubaty, a former government adviser in Yemen, said that if the audio recordings are proven, it shows Saleh as “a master of mischief” in the country. On Wednesday, Saleh called for early elections, arguing that early presidential and parliamentary polls would help defuse the current political crisis. aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo Advertisement",

Yemen&#039;s President Ali Abdullah Saleh delivers his speech on state television in this still image taken from video October 8, 2011. (AFP) By MEE and agencies Published date: 13 February 2015 04:00 GMT | Last update: 10 years 11 months ago The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Yemen's former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and two senior Houthi rebel leaders for threatening the peace and stability of the country, two days after Saleh walked out on the new government. The US Treasury said it was blacklisting Saleh , Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim and Abd al-Khaliq al-Houthi \"for engaging in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" The US move followed similar action by the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on the three men last week, for threatening peace in the impoverished Arab country. The UN sanctions prompted Saleh to pull his General People's Congress party out of the just-formed unity cabinet, plunging the country back into political crisis after months of attempts to foster a peace deal between Saleh , the Houthi insurgents believed allied to him, and their political rivals. The Treasury said the three men \"have, using violence and other means, undermined the political process in Yemen and obstructed the implementation of its political transition, outlined by the agreement of November 23, 2011... which provides for a peaceful transition of power in Yemen.\" New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters The sanctions freeze any assets the three might have in US jurisdictions and forbids Americans from doing business with them. #Yemen 's Ali Abdullah Saleh, among 8 Richest dictators in history,$32 Billion. Sanctions freeze his assets in US. https://t.co/6HyaMvlhes — Joyce Karam (@Joyce_Karam) November 10, 2014 Saleh was the turbulent country's president from 1990 to 2012 before he was forced to step down following nationwide protests. The US Treasury said that since then he has \"reportedly become one of the primary supporters of violence perpetrated by individuals affiliated with the Houthi group.\" Hakim, the Treasury said, was implicated in plotting a coup attempt against Yemen President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi as the Houthi forces sought to take over Sanaa, Yemen's capital. The Treasury added that Hakim remained in Sanaa in September \"to organize military operations so as to be able to topple the Yemeni government\" if peace efforts failed. Analysts say the sanctions could be counter-productive. \"Considering the increasing unpopularity of the UN and of western actors’ interventions in the country, it seems very possible that the issuing of sanctions could backfire. Even many who back the punitive measures see them as too little, too late,\" said Adam Baron, a journalist recently expelled from Yemen in a report for the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"Whether or not they prove effective in the short term, punitive measures by themselves will not bring Yemen closer to stability. More than anything, what Yemen needs is a government that is capable of demonstrating its legitimacy and showing that it is able to solve at least some of the many problems the impoverished country face.\" The timing could not have been worse, said Abdullah Hamidaddin, a PhD candidate in King’s College London with a focus on Saudi Arabia and Yemen. \"This will fall right into the hands of Saleh. The Americans literally extended a lifeline to the former Yemeni strongman, pushed him to the limelight, and emboldened his supporters to chant his name again,\" writes Hamidaddin. New cabinet Yemen's new government was announced on Friday under President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah. The new cabinet includes 37 ministers, including the prime minister, according to Yemeni television. There are 29 newcomers, while seven ministers have retained their posts. https://twitter.com/abubakrabdullah/status/531774350861795328 The new 36-member cabinet was formed as part of a UN-brokered peace deal under which the Houthis are supposed to withdraw from Sana’a, which they seized on 21 September. On 1 November, the main parties signed an agreement brokered by the UN envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, for the formation of a government of technocrats. Rebel representatives and their rivals, the Sunni Al-Islah (Reform) Islamic party, mandated Hadi to form a government and committed to support it. Washington welcomed the new cabinet. \"This multi-party cabinet must represent the strength of Yemeni unity over individual and partisan interests that may seek to derail the goals of a nation,\" US National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. Benomar has warned in an interview with AFP that, without the rapid formation of a government, tensions between Shiites and Sunnis were likely to increase, sinking the country deeper into crisis. The new cabinet was formed shortly before the UN Security Council Friday imposed its sanctions against Saleh and two rebel Houthi commanders. The Houthis are widely thought to be backed by Saleh , with Washington accusing him of being \"behind the attempts to cause chaos throughout Yemen\" by using them to weaken the government and \"create enough instability to stage a coup\". Saleh's ruling party the GPC said the UN decision to penalise Saleh for allegedly obstructing the political process is \"strange\", insisting that the former strongman had \"stepped down peacefully\" for the sake of a political compromise. Saleh said he was willing to give up the immunity he was granted after stepping down in February 2012 following nationwide protests, and to face Yemeni justice. \"Find any [corruption] files, refer them to justice and lift the immunity. I will be there to appear in court,\" he told the GPC. Middle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was relased on Tuesday, and handed over to local tribes in the southern province of Shabwa, a representative of the group told the Associated Press news agency. Mubarak was kidnapped days before the Shia rebel group took over key parts of the capital Sanaa. He was previously nominated as prime minister, but his appointment was rejected by the Shia rebel group. Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbara said freeing Mubarak could be seen as “a first step towards reconciliation” in the country. “This could be part of a confidence-building step.” Several ministers under Hadi remain on house arrest. Hadi announced last week that he would leave office under Houthi pressure. But his resignation has not been finalised. Ahelbara said that despite Mubarak’s release, the country remains in a political deadlock. “It’s a very delicate situation now, not only for Yemenis but for neighbouring countries like Saudi Arabia,” he said. “If this continues, you might see Yemen disintegrating.” aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo Advertisement",

    "source_text": "Yemen crisis: President resigns as rebels tighten hold - BBC News Image source, Reuters Image caption, Shia Houthi rebels continued to ring the presidential palace in Sanaa on Thursday The president of Yemen has resigned along with his prime minister in protest at the takeover of the capital Sanaa by Shia Houthi rebels, creating a dangerous political vacuum. President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi said he could not continue after the Houthis failed to honour a peace deal. Parliament has reportedly refused to accept the resignations. Security sources have told the BBC that Yemen&#x27;s intelligence chief, Ali Hassan al-Ahmedi, has also stepped down. There are reports of explosions in the southern port city of Aden, where President Hadi has a strong following. Houthi rebel figures publicly welcomed the resignation of the president with one proposing the creation of a ruling council. The council would include Houthi-led groups, Abu al-Malek Yousef al-Fishi was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Houthi leaders had previously committed themselves to withdrawing from key positions around the presidential palace and the home of President Hadi. The US, which is helping fight al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, said it was still assessing the implications of President Hadi&#x27;s move. Image source, AFP Image caption, The struggle in the capital has gripped the country Image source, AFP Image caption, Aden airport in south Yemen was shut down in protest at rebel actions in the capital Image source, EPA Image caption, Tribal gunmen in the oil-rich province of Maarib could be seen mustering on Thursday, apparently to ward off possible attacks by the Shia Houthi rebels Analysis: Sebastian Usher, BBC World Service The resignation of the Yemeni president and his government is likely to plunge an already unstable country into uncharted territory. Mr Hadi has been surrounded in his home in the capital, Sanaa, by rebels for several days. His resignation may be the last card he had left to play after being pushed to the brink. The rebels have publicly welcomed his resignation but it is not what they wanted. As minority Shias from the north, their authority will not be accepted in the south, where many want to return to having their own state. With no president and no government, there is also a fear that al-Qaeda&#x27;s powerful branch in Yemen could make new gains from the political vacuum. &#x27;Political maze&#x27; Local officials in Aden told Reuters news agency that unidentified gunmen had attacked two military vehicles in the city early on Friday, local time. Three explosions were heard during the attack, which was followed by the clashes, said one of the officials, who declined to be identified. Explosions and clashes were also reported by Qatar-based broadcaster al-Jazeera, which said they were happening on the city&#x27;s Martyrs&#x27; Square. In his letter of resignation, seen by the Associated Press news agency, Mr Hadi said the parties had reached a &quot;deadlock&quot;. &quot;We found out that we are unable to achieve the goal, for which we bear a lot of pain and disappointment,&quot; he said. Image source, AP Image caption, President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi has been in power since 2012 Image source, EPA Image caption, Prime Minister Khaled Bahah was in office for just over three months A government source told the BBC that ministers were resigning in protest at the rebels&#x27; challenge to Yemen&#x27;s sovereignty and their seizure of state institutions. In his resignation letter, Prime Minister Khaled Bahah said the cabinet did not want to be dragged into an &quot;unconstructive political maze&quot;. Earlier this week, Houthi gunmen fired on Mr Bahah&#x27;s convoy and then laid siege to the presidential palace, where he was staying. Then on Wednesday the home of President Hadi was shelled, shattering a ceasefire that had been agreed only hours earlier. The ceasefire deal had met a series of rebel demands including the expansion of Houthi representation in parliament and state institution. In return, the rebels said they would pull back from their positions and free the president&#x27;s chief-of-staff, whom they have held since Saturday. But so far they have not done so. The Houthis, who follow a branch of Shia Islam known as Zaidism, have staged periodic uprisings since 2004 in an effort to win greater autonomy for their northern heartland of Saada province. Since July the rebels have inflicted defeats on tribal and militia groups backed by the leading Sunni Islamist party, Islah, and battled al-Qaeda as they have pushed into central and western provinces.

Chechnya&#39;s Forgotten Children Of The Holodomor Share Share Copy link Facebook X (Twitter) LinkedIn Email Share Share Copy link Facebook X (Twitter) LinkedIn Email Print Lyuba was just a child when her family fled the &quot;Holodomor,&quot; the devastating famine that swept through Soviet Ukraine in the early 1930s. She and her parents were able to escape their homeland before its territory was sealed off in January 1933 at the height of the famine, which claimed millions of lives, on the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin. While many other Holodomor refugees tried to reach neighboring Romania or Poland, the family instead chose to head southeast to Soviet-ruled Chechnya, whose residents were then rumored to offer food and shelter to starving Ukrainians. Lyuba's parents, however, died of starvation during the journey. The little girl was taken to a Chechen orphanage, where she quickly assimilated the local language and customs. She ended up spending the rest of her life among her adoptive people, along with an indeterminate number of Ukrainian children either orphaned by the famine or entrusted to Chechens by their starving relatives -- an episode of the Holodomor that remains virtually undocumented. Lyuba has since passed away. But 80 years after the famine, her memory lives on in Chechnya. Amina, a retired schoolteacher who knew her personally, says Lyuba eventually settled in the village of Belgatoy. She describes Lyuba as deeply attached to her husband, a Chechen, with whom she had two children who both died in infancy. Tragedy hit again in 1994 when Russia launched its first war on Chechen separatists, indiscriminately shelling cities and villages. &quot;She lived in poverty after her husband died during the Russian-Chechen War. People brought her food and helped her, including the imam,&quot; Amina recalls. &quot;When I came to the village to visit my parents, I asked her to come and live with me in the city. I told her I would feed her, give her clothes, and take her into my home,&quot; she continues. &quot;But she refused, saying that this was the village where she had lived with her husband and where he and their children were buried, that she wanted to watch over their graves. And she stayed there until her own death.&quot; 'Repaying Kindness With Kindness' Despite the lack of archival evidence, accounts of Ukrainians finding refuge from the Holodomor are abundant in Chechnya. Pensioner Khozha Yakhyayev says his village, Chechen Aul, welcomed as many as 100 Ukrainian families during the famine. Yakhyayev says his uncle, who was then the village head, often recalled their arrival. &quot;When they came, exhausted with hunger, he offered them hospitality,&quot; Yakhyayev says. &quot;There were 500 families in Chechen Aul back then, and every fifth family took Ukrainians into their homes. They supported them until 1938. Some of the children were orphans whose parents had died of starvation.&quot; PHOTO GALLERY: Alexander Wienerberger was recruited into the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I.

Photo Gallery: Ukraine&#39;s Holodomor Through An Austrian&#39;s Eyes Alexander Wienerberger was recruited into the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I. In 1915, he was taken prisoner in Russia and ended up staying in the U.S.S.R. until 1934. Later, he worked as a chemical engineer specializing in explosives, and he established chemical factories in the Soviet Union. In 1933, he was assigned as technical director of a synthetic factory in Kharkiv and became witness to the man-made famine orchestrated by the Soviet government, the Holodomor. His photographs -- made with a Leica camera -- are some of about 100 images verified to be authentic portrayals of those harrowing events. The captions are based on the photographer&#39;s own notes. Today, only a handful of ethnic Ukrainians still live in Chechen Aul. Many returned to their native country when the famine ended or, later, when the war broke out in Chechnya. According to Yakhyayev, some of them also chose to follow their adoptive families into exile when Stalin ordered the deportation of Chechens in 1944. While some returned, many died on the grueling journey to Central Asia and Siberia or in the years that followed. Those who stayed took care of the homes left behind by the deported Chechens: &quot;The Ukrainians repaid kindness with kindness. They took care of the empty houses and the belonging left behind by the Chechens, they looked after their cattle,&quot; Yakhyayev says. &quot;They did their best to preserve these houses and protect them from looting.&quot; Chechens Remember Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, scholars and historians have gathered thousands of testimonies from Holodomor survivors. But to this day, few outside Chechnya are aware of the role Chechens played in saving Ukrainians from starvation. Vasyl Marochka, one of Ukraine's leading Holodomor historians, says there is no known record of Ukrainians fleeing to Chechnya during the famine. Chechen historian Vakhit Akayev says family photographs and other potential evidence of these events likely disappeared during the deportation of Chechens and the two subsequent wars. &quot;New events unfolded, new, even more horrific tragedies eclipsed old ones,&quot; he says. &quot;This is why this topic has never been researched.&quot; Chechens, however, have not forgotten the children of the Holodomor. Late Chechen folk singer Imam Alimsultanov devoted a song to them titled &quot;Ukraine, Thank You.&quot; &quot;It was in the 1930s, destiny brought us together already back then,&quot; he sings. &quot;Hunger, destruction all around, Chechnya took in Ukrainians.&quot; Claire Bigg Claire Bigg covers Russia, Ukraine, and the post-Soviet world, with a focus on human rights, civil society, and social issues.

    "claim_container": "Many returning Chechens were settled in the lowland steppe regions, and in Grozny itself rather than the historical mountainous districts. The goal of this (and, indeed, adding Shelkovskaya and Naursky to Checheno-Ingushetia) was to try to forcefully assimilate the Chechens by keeping them away from the mountains and reminders of \"their ancient struggles\", and to keep them mixed in with supposedly more loyal Russians so they could not rebel without a counter-force present.[118][119] Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to weaken the potential for national awakening and uprising failed, however, due to the Vainakh's much higher birthrate.[120] It did however succeed in deepening and renewing ethnic conflict between Chechens and Russians. The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership (they had come to view the lands they had settled as \"theirs\") and job competition, rioted as early as 1958.[121] In the 1958 Grozny riots, the Russians seized the central government buildings and demanded either a restoring of Grozny Oblast, or a creation of a non-titular autonomy, re-deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, establishment of \"Russian power\", mass search and disarming of the Vainakh, before Soviet law-enforcement dispersed the rioters.[122][123] On 27 August 1958, Major General Stepanov of the Military Aviation School issued an ultimatum to the local Soviet government that the Chechens must be sent back to Siberia and Central Asia or otherwise his Russians would \"tear (them) to pieces\".[123] Although the riot was dispersed and it was denounced as \"chauvinistic\", afterward, the republican government made special efforts to please the Russian populace, and mass discrimination against the Chechens aimed at preserving the privileged position of the Russians commenced (see below).",

Фото участника событий ПОСЛЕ XX съезда КПСС началась реабилитация и отдельных граждан, и целых народов, пострадавших в годы беззакония. Девятого января 1957 г. председатель президиума ВС СССР Климент Ворошилов подписал Указ \"О восстановлении Чечено-Ингушской АССР в составе РСФСР\". \"В целях создания необходимых условий для национального развития чеченского и ингушского народов\" представителям этих народов разрешалось вернуться на прежнее место жительства. Сложному механизму возвращения ингушей и чеченцев власти с самого начала пытались придать планомерный характер. Однако процесс переселения вскоре вышел из-под контроля. Только за 1957 год в автономную республику прибыло свыше 200 тыс. чел., что существенно превышало цифры, предусмотренные четырехлетним планом переселения. Это создавало серьезные проблемы с трудоустройством и обеспечением жильем. К тому же - массовое приобретение оружия, круговая порука, убийства на почве кровной мести, изнасилования, нападения на жителей республики, представляющих другие национальности. Прибывшие шейхи, муллы и тейповые авторитеты, воздействуя на молодежь в националистическом и религиозном духе, стремились оживить идеи мюридизма и повиновения законам шариата. Это повлекло за собой резкий рост уголовных преступлений среди молодежи. За 9 месяцев 1957 года в Грозном было совершено 22 убийства. Органами милиции привлечено к уголовной ответственности 285 человек. В первой половине 1958 года по сравнению с аналогичным периодом 1957 года в целом по ЧИ АССР количество убийств увеличилось в 2 раза, а случаев разбоя и хулиганства, повлекших за собой тяжкие телесные повреждения, в 3 раза. По всей республике стали обыденным явлением ссоры из-за домов и приусадебных участков, скандалы и групповые драки с применением холодного и огнестрельного оружия. Так, например, в конце 1957 года в Грозном распространялись антирусские листовки, были зафиксированы и нападения чеченской молодежи на учащихся ремесленных училищ и офицеров Советской Армии. \"Дела совсем плохие, - писала одна из русских жительниц Чечни своей родственнице в Россию, - приезжают чеченцы, творят что только вздумается, бьют русских, режут, убивают, ночью поджигают дома. Народ в панике. Многие уехали, а остальные собираются\". И действительно, в результате запугивания, при полном попустительстве республиканских властей в течение 1957 года за пределы ЧИ АССР выехали 113 тысяч русских, осетин, аварцев, украинцев и граждан других национальностей. Справедливое возмущение населения бесчинствами хулиганских элементов из числа чеченцев, а также неспособность власти реально защитить некоренных жителей спровоцировали русское население Грозного на массовые беспорядки, произошедшие в городе 26 и 27 августа 1958 г., ставшие классическим примером не раз описанного в исторической литературе \"русского бунта\", отчаянного и жестокого. Вечером 23 августа 1958 года в пригороде Грозного, поселке Черноречье, где преимущественно проживали рабочие и служащие Грозненского химического завода, чеченец Лулу Мальсагов, находясь в нетрезвом состоянии, устроил драку с русским парнем Владимиром Коротчевым и нанес ему ножевые ранения в живот. Чуть позже Мальсагов вместе с другими чеченцами встретили только что демобилизованного из армии рабочего завода Евгения Степашина и несколько раз ударили его ножом. Ранения Степашина оказались смертельными, а Коротчева удалось спасти. Слухи об убийстве двадцатидвухлетнего русского парня быстро разнеслись среди рабочих завода и жителей Грозного. Несмотря на то что убийца и его сообщники были сразу задержаны милицией, реакция общественности была необычайно бурной, особенно среди молодежи. Стали раздаваться требования сурово наказать убийц. 25-26 августа проститься с погибшим в поселок Черноречье прибыло много людей, требовавших публичной казни убийц Степашина. Многие из числа собравшихся у гроба погибшего настаивали на необходимости проведения траурного митинга с участием руководства обкома и горкома КПСС, Совета Министров ЧИ АССР. Однако по указанию того же обкома проведение какого-либо митинга разрешено не было. Тем не менее на территории химического завода и в Черноречье появились объявления о якобы предстоящем траурном митинге, организуемом в связи с убийством рабочего Степашина. 26 августа в 14 часов свыше трех тысяч человек, подняв на руки гроб с телом погибшего, направились в центр Грозного. Протестующие намеревались провести митинг на площади Ленина у здания обкома, на котором собирались вновь заявить о своих требованиях публичной казни арестованных, выселения паразитических элементов из числа чеченцев, проживающих в Черноречье. Но и в обкоме, и в горкоме партии не сочли нужным вступать в полемику с горожанами и давать им какие-либо объяснения. Власть отгородилась от возмущенного народа кордоном милиции, которой было дано указание не допустить траурную процессию к зданию обкома КПСС. Однако толпе вместе с гробом убитого удалось достичь своей цели. Примкнувшие к жителям Черноречья большие группы грозненской молодежи опрокинули несколько автомашин, выставленных в качестве заграждения, и демонстрация хлынула на площадь Ленина, где начался траурный митинг. Между тем некоторые из митингующих предприняли попытку проникнуть в здание обкома, и в 19 часов 30 минут им это удалось. Группа молодежи ворвалась в обком и попыталась силой вытащить на площадь председателя Совета Министров ЧИ АССР Гайербекова, второго секретаря обкома КПСС Чахкиева и других работников. С большим трудом сотрудникам КГБ и МВД удалось изгнать из обкома прорвавшихся туда демонстрантов и задержать наиболее активных из них. Для успокоения собравшихся на площадь все же вышли секретари обкома партии Г.Я. Черкевич, Б.Ф. Сайко, секретарь горкома А.И. Шепелев. Однако вместо обстоятельного разговора о волнующих людей проблемах они выступили с призывом прекратить беспорядки. В ответ из толпы послышались возгласы: \"Вон чеченцев из Грозного\", \"Пусть к нам приедет Н.С. Хрущев, мы с ним поговорим\", \"Да здравствует Грозненская область!\" и т.п. Толпа все прибывала и прибывала. Со столов организованного накануне книжного базара стали свободно выступать все желающие. Митингующие стали нападать на военные и милицейские автомашины и откатывать их вместе с солдатами на прилегающие к площади улицы. Были остановлены и избиты два чеченца, проезжавшие мимо на мотоцикле. В окна обкома полетели первые камни. К 23 часам к месту митинга прибыло еще несколько машин с солдатами местного гарнизона, которым вместе с милицией удалось рассеять толпу и задержать 41 активного участника беспорядков. К половине второго ночи на площади был полностью восстановлен порядок. Однако еще вечером 26 августа среди собравшихся распространился слух о том, что в 9 часов утра на том же месте состоится новый митинг, на котором якобы должны выступить срочно прилетевшие из Москвы члены советского правительства и ЦК КПСС. На следующий день в 7 часов утра недалеко от здания обкома стали появляться группы горожан, главным образом женщины, которые наперебой обсуждали вчерашние события и выражали явное недовольство задержанием активистов митинга. Появились даже листовки, призывающие к возобновлению акции протеста. В одной из таких листовок говорилось: \"Товарищи! Вчера проносили мимо обкома гроб товарища, зарезанного чеченцами. Вместо того чтобы принять соответствующие меры по отношению к убийцам, милиция разогнала демонстрацию рабочих и арестовала 50 человек ни в чем не повинных людей. Так давайте же бросим работу в 11 часов и пойдем в обком партии с требованием освободить товарищей!\" К 10 часам утра около здания обкома собралась толпа - около 2 тысяч человек. Наступил критический момент, когда люди подошли вплотную к зданию обкома, разорвали кольцо оцепления из солдат и милиционеров и стали ломиться в двери центрального входа. Вскоре навстречу митингующим вышли секретарь Грозненского горкома партии Шепелев и председатель горисполкома Брыскин, которые тут же были схвачены толпой и препровождены к памятнику Ленина, где была сооружена импровизированная трибуна. Но ни Шепелеву, ни Брыскину выступать не дали. Народ хотел, чтобы на этот раз власти предержащие сами выслушали его мнение. К полудню на площади Ленина скопилось около 10 тысяч человек. Выступающие настойчиво повторяли свои требования - освободить товарищей, арестованных накануне. Над головами людей из динамиков слышались призывы: \"Освободите арестованную молодежь!\", \"Вышлите чечен из Грозного!\" К 14 часам часть толпы в количестве более тысячи человек подошла к зданиям КГБ и МВД республики. Несколько человек проникли на балкон здания МВД и потребовали освободить всех задержанных накануне. Под давлением масс власти пошли на уступки и выпустили всех на свободу. Другой группе удалось прорваться в здание КГБ и нанести некоторый материальный ущерб: были выбиты стекла, выломаны двери и т.п. Прорыв чекистам удалось быстро ликвидировать, причем без применения оружия. Разгоряченная толпа моментально обращала свой гнев на любых людей чеченской национальности, появившихся возле площади. Так, во время митинга были захвачены двое чеченцев Матаев и Темиров, которых тут же подвергли избиению. От полученных побоев Матаев вскоре скончался. Около 15 часов группа демонстрантов, отделившись от основной массы, направилась в сторону Грозненского горкома КПСС. Взломав дверь, люди ворвались в помещение и устроили погром. А спустя два часа митингующие взяли штурмом и здание обкома, где, захватив десяток пишущих машинок, несколько активистов стали печатать листовки и воззвания, которые тут же зачитывались с балкона собравшимся. Была наспех написана и обращенная к властям резолюция митинга. \"Учитывая проявление со стороны чечено-ингушского населения зверского отношения к народам других национальностей, выражающегося в резне, убийствах, насилии и издевательствах, - говорилось в ней, - трудящиеся города Грозного от имени большинства населения республики предлагают: 1. С 27 августа 1958 года переименовать ЧИ АССР в Грозненскую область или же в Межнациональную советскую социалистическую республику; 2. Чечено-ингушскому населению разрешить проживать в Грозненской области не более 10% от общего количества населения; 3. Переселить передовую прогрессивную комсомольскую молодежь различных национальностей из других республик для освоения богатств Грозненской области и для развития сельского хозяйства...\" Один из активистов, шофер автотранспортной конторы, предъявил ультиматум находившемуся в обкоме начальнику местного военного авиационного училища генерал-майору Степанову: либо выйти к толпе и выступить перед ней с заявлением о том, что чеченцы будут выселены из Грозного, либо быть через несколько минут растерзанным. Взбунтовавшихся в здании обкома попытались приостановить группа секретарей первичных партийных организаций города и других партийных работников. Однако все они были избиты демонстрантами и выгнаны на улицу. Захватив в обкоме знамя, часть толпы численностью в 500 человек направилась на штурм главпочтамта. Ворвавшись в здание, демонстранты потребовали связать их с Москвой. Не сумев дозвониться до Москвы, толпа направилась на междугородную телефонную станцию. При попытке проникнуть внутрь был убит охраной рабочий химзавода Андрианов, и еще 2 человека получили ранения. Под угрозой насилия телефонисты все же организовали активистам митинга связь с приемной первого секретаря ЦК КПСС Хрущева. В 23 часа группа демонстрантов с красным знаменем направилась на Грозненский вокзал и задержала отправление поезда Ростов-Баку. Люди ходили по вагонам и просили пассажиров рассказать жителям других городов, что \"в Грозном чеченцы убивают русск",

Simon Sebag Montefiore finds out why Courting the king of the wild frontier The reception in Westminster for the visiting president was grand enough for a European head of state. A regimental band in full played its bagpipes; the champagne flowed; there were British generals and politicians; there were Thatcher's impish friend Lord McAlpine, now leader of the Referendum Movement, comedian Rory Bremner, Lord Tebbit, Labour and Tory MPs, William Cash and his svelte daughter Letitia, Field Marshal Lord Bramall in uniform; and there was Sir James Goldsmith's widow, the formidable Lady Annabel. There were phalanxes of beautiful London socialities and British merchant adventurers hoping to make vast fortunes in remote lands. Burning torches lit up the darkness, paparazzi fought for photographs, the massed bands of retired Scots Guardsmen, dressed up in uniforms that belonged on the set of The Charge of the Light Brigade, burst into Amazing Grace - and the president, with tough bodyguards and British peers, arrived. So who was the leader? Chirac, Clinton or Kohl? No, he was Aslan Maskhadov, president of the Ichkerian Republic of Chechnya, the tiny war-torn but oil-rich republic that defeated Russia. His visit to London last week culminated incongruously in a dinner at the Ritz with Baroness Thatcher, a walkabout with Imran Khan, the cricketer husband of Jemima Goldsmith, and the plaudits of Cat Stevens, the 1960s troubadour now known as Yusuf Islam, who praised brave Chechnya beside the lustrous Jemima. There were It girls asking whether the Chechens were from Czechoslovakia and whether it was a fancy dress party. There were young Chechen men in fur hats who had fought and triumphed in the battle of Grozny. There was a flamboyant Chelsea designer in pink plastic and shades. And there were Georgians, Ingushetians, Azeris, Dagestanis, all the colourful romantic peoples of the wild and noble Caucasus. It was a wonderful cosmopolitan and unlikely scene, as far from my memories of grim, doomed Grozny, the capital city, as it was possible to be. This is about more than an exotic visit. This is the story of the strange new alliance between the Chechens and the leaders of Goldsmith's Referendum party - how the Goldsmith millions may be used to rebuild the ruins of Grozny. Bizarrely, this new alliance and the possible investment of the Goldsmith fortune in Chechnya would fulfil the old Chechen legend from Queen Victoria's time that good Britain would one day save their benighted land. The party reached a climax when the two worlds of East and West, of the warrior nation of heroes and western dynasty of plutocrats met in the persons of President Maskhadov and Lady Annabel. Gradually, the symbols of these two powers moved towards each other through the crowd of fighting photographers and bemused beauties, until they came together with a burst of excitement like the clashing of cymbals in the military band. Cynics ask: are the Chechens just the &quot;new Zulus&quot;? Goldsmith and casino owner John Aspinall famously supported the Zulus, possibly because western businessmen delude themselves that they are the &quot;warriors of the boardroom&quot;. But if we have an ideal of the martial vigour of a warrior nation, no people live up to it like the Chechens. At the president's receptions there were also veteran Chechen supporters wondering where the fashionable Goldsmith set was when the Chechens were actually desperately fighting for survival in 1994. Then, when the intervention of Britain's beautiful people could have been invaluable, the cause was argued only by Prince Charles Tchkotoua, the Chechen ambassador to Europe, a Georgian millionaire and a few journalists and dons. Is the Goldsmith fortune really to be invested in Grozny? If so, there could be no finer cause than that of this swashbuckling warrior nation with which to remember the tycoon. The president, this lion of the Caucasus, is the shy soldier who defeated the entire Russian army in pitched battle. He was an obscure Soviet artillery colonel of Chechen race until the fall of the Soviet Union. It was Maskhadov, displaying a genius for guerrilla warfare that recalls Vietnam's General Giap, who in a ghastly war won effective independence for Chechnya. &quot;Even when my HQ was underground, under the presidential palace in Grozny surrounded by Russians, I knew we would win,&quot; says Maskhadov, in suit and high fur hat. &quot;Because the Chechen is born free in every age and we never give up.&quot; But every western country fears Russia too much to recognise Chechnya. Hence this was not a formal state visit, though it was considerably more exciting than a real one. The Chechens, whose national symbol is the wolf, are a brave mountain race who have faced the most vicious suppression by the Russian empire. Under two great leaders, the 18th-century Shaik Mansour and the famous 19th-century imam, Shamil, the Chechens defeated the Russians. Shamil finally surrendered in 1859. In 1944 Stalin ordered the deportation of the entire Chechen race to central Asia. At least 400,000 died in camps or beside the railway tracks. Maskhadov himself was born of deported parents in exile in Kazakhstan in 1951. Chechnya is now independent but ruined. It is cursed by the kidnappings of westerners, particularly two Britons, Camilla Carr and Jon James. &quot;It is a tragedy for them, but it's a tragedy for us, too,&quot; says Maskhadov. &quot;Before I came to London I did everything I could to find them. I think we will liberate them, but it's a matter of time.&quot; It seems a very long time since I was in Chechnya before the war in 1994 and first met a quiet Chechen commander called Maskhadov in a dark little office in Grozny's now destroyed presidential palace. &quot;I remember us meeting,&quot; he says. &quot;But I cannot believe so much has happened since. We must rebuild and we must attract investment.&quot; This is where the Goldsmiths come in. If half of the president's visit is for public relations purposes, the other is to clinch deals to reconstruct Grozny, to invest in Chechen oil and create a viable economy. That is why, behind all the razzmatazz, the president is being guided into the British Establishment by the lieutenants of the Referendum party - McAlpine and Patrick Robertson, Goldsmith's former PR impresario, who are the co-ordinators of this visit. &quot;Chechnya,&quot; explains Maskhadov, &quot;is at the heart of the Caucasus, close to the vast oil reserves in the Caspian, crossed by oil pipelines, near the Silk Road.&quot; &quot;Is the Goldsmith family going to invest in the rebuilding of Grozny?&quot; &quot;I don't want to talk about such things. But everything that represents Britain and Chechnya working together to open doors to investment in our country is good.&quot; &quot;But your business advisers have chosen Lord McAlpine and Patrick Robertson, backed by the Goldsmiths, as the group to rebuild Grozny?&quot; &quot;It's possible.&quot; &quot;You're a fan of Imran Khan?&quot; &quot;I don't know much about him. He came to Grozny to sign some trade protocols.&quot; This was at the start of the Referendum set's flirtation with Grozny when Imran visited Grozny to help find the British hostages. Details of the deal are foggy: the immediate aim of the Goldsmith group is to promote a new oil company called the Trans-Caucasus Energy Company to market Chechen oil and a Caucasus Investment Fund, chaired by McAlpine, to reconstruct the Chechen infrastructure. These companies have sponsored Maskhadov's visit. It is through the investment fund that the Goldsmith millions would be channelled to help the Chechens. &quot;Our elders,&quot; says the president, &quot;have always said Britain will be the best friend of Chechnya. There is a legend . . .&quot; When I was there, Chechens frequently told me we would &quot;one day share a king&quot;. Once again, the Chechen wolf stalks London.

The hostages -- Britons Peter Kennedy , Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw -- were engineers working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company. Their heads were found about 25 miles (40 km) south of Grozny and were identified by a bodyguard. Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had been found as well, but gave no further details. In Grozny, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the slayings were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its independence effort. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya on unidentified \"outside forces\" and their Chechen henchmen. Kidnappings have become common in Chechnya since the end of the region's two-year war for independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed. This year, 176 people have been kidnapped, and 90 of them have been released, according to official accounts. The four men found dead Tuesday had been living in an armed complex as guests of the Chechen separatist government while they worked to install phone lines across the breakaway Russian province. A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, \"We have heard the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing we can say at this stage.\" Chechen authorities said they had several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress. Maskhadov said he was saddened and angered by the news, and would send messages of condolences to the governments of Britain and New Zealand. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

Murrah Federal Building once stood. He handed the shovel to young Clint Seidl, who was in the second grade when his mother died in the 1995 bombing. She worked for the Secret Service, and Clint said he wants to do the same. Gore said several agents wanted to talk with Clint after the ceremony. Gore told those who ever wanted to demean the work of federal workers to \"come here and be silent and remember.\" One after another, people grasped the shovel Gore passed to them and, dressed in their Sunday best, took a turn tossing a chunk of soil into a pile. \"Being down here always takes us back,\" said Diane Leonard, whose husband died in the April 19, 1995 bombing that also left 500 injured. The $24.1 million memorial will include a reflecting pool, an interactive museum and 168 stone chairs built atop glass bases, one for each of the people killed. A portion of the chain-link fence that surrounds the bomb site will be kept as part of the memorial. The fence has become a shrine, with visitors leaving mementos. The fence holds \"the real story of our democracy. This is how we feel,\" Gore said. One man who attended the service said it was time to move ahead. \"A lot of us want to get along with our lives and forget the tragedy but not the people inside. That is what we want to remember,\" said Greg Smith. Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for the bombing. Terry Nichols was sentenced Gates deposition tapes part of trial WASHINGTON - Bill Gates was out of his element, to be sure. Given to blunt talk as the combative chairperson of Microsoft Corp., Gates had to weigh his words cautiously under the probing of two government adversaries. For almost three days this summer, in a windowless conference room at Microsoft headquarters near Seattle, Gates resisted them. It was 20 hours of verbal jousting between the world's richest man and the government's top lawyers bent on proving him a predatory monopolist. Gates, admired and loathed for Microsoft's remarkable influence within the technology industry, won't testify to defend his company during the historic antitrust trial in Washington entering its second week. But he is such a central figure that government lawyers plan to show videotapes tomorrow of hours of his pretrial depositions, then to release the tape to television stations as evidence in the case. In the tapes, Gates discusses his fears that Internet software by rival Netscape Communications Corp., coupled with a new programming language called Java that doesn't require Windows, threatened his lucrative Windows operating system. The government contends Microsoft struck back against Netscape. First he illegally offered to divide the Internet software market, prosecutors allege, then with an all-out campaign to crush Netscape with its Windows software, used in more than 80 percent of the nation's desktop computers. The spectacle of millions of TV viewers watching Gates on tape bobbing and weaving through tough questions could be a public-relations disaster for Microsoft, even if Gates testifies to nothing incriminating. Sniper kills New York abortion doctor BUFFALO, N.Y. - Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was killed by a sniper who fired a rifle bullet through a window in his home Friday night. His was the first fatality among five sniper attacks on upstate New York or Canadian abortion providers in the last four years. The killer remained at large yesterday as an international investigation continued. Police listed no suspects. All of the previous attacks have occurred within a few weeks of Nov. 11, Veteran's Day, which is known as Remembrance Day in Canada. Around the World Hurricane Mitch threatens Caribbean KINGSTON, Jamaica - Driving rain squalls spawned by Hurricane Mitch forced churches to cancel services yesterday, flooded streets in the Jamaican capital of Kingston and sent residents scurrying for provisions. Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, swirled in the western Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica. Packing 145-mph winds, Mitch was a powerful Category 4 hurricane that could also threaten the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Honduras and Colombia's tiny islands off Central America, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane warnings were posted for Jamaica and eastern Cuba and a hurricane watch was in effect for the tourist islands of the Caymans. At 4 p.m. EST, Mitch was about 190 miles south-southwest of Grand Cayman. Crawling west-northwest at 8 mph, its hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph extended 70 miles from the center. Sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards while squalls pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern districts. With rain expected at least through today, authorities warned of mudslides and flash floods, especially in the mountains. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appealed for calm, shelters opened and Jamaica's defense forces went on alert. Residents cleared shelves of bakery items, batteries and other goods at the few Kingston markets open yesterday. Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and Montego Bay airports remained open. In Cuba, civil defense authorities began warning citizens in the eastern part of the island yesterday. Cuba's eastern half was battered by Hurricane Georges a month ago. Forecasters were keeping close watch on the storm, Jose Rubiera of the Cuban Meteorological Institute told the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina. In western Jamaica, hoteliers and tourists kept a wary eye on the storm's progress. \"It's not a very good beach day,\" said Rohan Watson, a manager at the Negril Inn in the western resort of Negril. Employees stockpiled food and plywood to board windows in case Mitch threatened, he said. \"People are still coming in. I think most people think the weather's going to pass,\" said an optimistic Marcia Tomlinson, a receptionist at the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern coastal resort of Montego Bay. In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert killed 45 people in Jamaica. The island was spared, however, by Hurricane Georges, which killed more than 500 people in the northeast Caribbean last month. In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of about 28,000, some boat owners secured their vessels and residents stocked up on essentials. The government allowed markets - normally closed by law on Sunday - to open. Bomb blast kills Chechnya ofcial GROZNY, Russia - Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official was killed yesterday when a bomb tore his car to pieces on the day he was to launch a major offensive on hostage-takers in the breakaway republic. Shadid Bargishev's two bodyguards were in critical condition, and several passersby also were injured, doctors said. Bargishev died on the operating table after losing both legs in the blast in the parking lot of the anti-kidnapping department office in the Chechen capital of Grozny. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's office said in a statement. The remote-controlled bomb was planted just inside the gate to the parking lot, the Interfax news agency said. The explosion came as law enforcement officials were preparing a large operation to rescue people kidnapped in Chechnya. Bargishev's colleagues insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Authorities stepped up security around Chechnya after the explosion, posting police on major highways and large cities, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's recent success in securing the release of several hostages, including 24 Russian soldiers and an English couple. 10-26-98 Previous Article Next Article HOME | NEWS | EDITORIAL | ARTS | SPORTS | ARCHIVES | &#169;1998 The Michigan Daily Letters to the editor should be sent to: [email&#160;protected] Comments about this site should be sent to: [email&#160;protected]",

    "source_text": "Dancing House in Prague Dancing House in Prague - \"Ginger and Fred\" The Dancing House is one of the most interesting Prague houses built at the end of the 20 th century. It represents a man and a woman, dancing together. It was regarded as very controversial several years ago, but on the other hand it is one of the most acclaimed modern buildings in Prague: it was awarded the Design of the year 1996 award from the American Time magazine. You can see this extraordinary house at the corner of Jirasek Square and Rasin Quay alongside the river Vltava. There used to stand a Neo-renaissance house before, but it was demolished by an American air attack in 1945. The space was empty for several decades then. Coincidentally, in the neighbouring house lived the former Czech republic president Vaclav Havel, and he ordered an architectural study of the place from Croatian architect Vlado Milunic . Finally, the Dutch company Nationale Nederlanden bought the place in 1992 and decided to build an administrative centre there. �Ginger and Fred� dancing on the riverside Vlado Milunic was asked to invite a world-renowned architect for the project, and he asked the famous Toronto architect and designer Frank O. Gehry . Together they built a dynamically looking building that seems to be dancing on the quay. It represents two dancers Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers � that�s why it�s also called �Ginger and Fred� . The glass tower Ginger bends and clings to the concrete tower Fred, which has a metal cupola on the top, representing hair. The house is an example of a deconstructivist architecture. Controversial building Critics of the building pointed out that it doesn�t fit into its surroundings, where various Art Noveau houses can be seen. Also the unusual shape of the building was seen as disputable. But after several years, it is regarded as one of the most interesting Prague buildings from the end of the previous century. The interior of the Dancing House was partly designed by the London architect of Czech origin Eva Jiricna. There are mostly offices in the nine-storey house, and there is a French restaurant with a beautiful view over Prague at the top.

Featuring two curved towers \"waltzing\", it is also occasionally referred to as the Fred and Ginger Building. Now, seven years after its completion, a new coffee table book simply entitled \"Dancing Building\" has just been brought out. Dr Jana Ticha of publishers Zlaty Rez said the book was a long time in gestation. Architect recalls genesis of Dancing Building as coffee table book published Vlado Milunic on the top of the Dancing Building, photo: CTK \"As we knew that this was a very difficult task we were a bit reluctant, to be honest. It took about half a year or so till we said, OK, let's do it. And it took two years, or two and a half from the very start of the research and of the real work on the book until we could publish the book now.\" Will it be available outside this country, to buy? \"Of course. It will be available in Europe and the US, where it will be distributed by Prototype Editions, in specialised bookshops...in the major architectural bookshops.\" The Dancing Building is the work of two men: Zagreb-born but Prague-based architect Vlado Milunic, who had the original idea for the building, and the celebrated American architect Frank Gehry, perhaps best-known for the stunning Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. I spoke to Mr Milunic on the terrace of the exclusive restaurant on the Dancing Building's seventh floor, from where the view is breathtaking. He told me he first conceived of the project back in the mid-1980s, in the company of his neighbour, the then-dissident Vaclav Havel. Both men lived beside where the Dancing Building now stands. \"In '86 I made a division in Havel's apartment, dividing Vaclav and his brother Ivan...\" In the building next door here? \"Yes. During the Velvet Revolution Havel became president and he said to me go ahead and make the first sketches.\" It's an incredible coincidence: you lived next door here in the same building as Vaclav Havel. Did Mr Havel have much involvement with the Dancing Building? \"Yes, yes. His support...there was a long, long list of coincidences involved in the making of the building. I lived in Havel's house and in the Velvet Revolution he became president...I spoke with Vaclav in '86 about the possibility to build a building on the corner. There was such a big list of incredible coincidences that I think it wasn't a coincidence but guiding from someone above, like God.\" As his ideas started taking shape after the Velvet Revolution, Vlado Milunic knew he wanted to create a building which reflected the new Czechoslovakia. \"The building had to reflect the situation of a Czechoslovak society who had forgotten the totalitarian past and moved into a world full of change. My first idea was to have a building with two different parts in dialogue, like static and dynamic, like plus and minus, like ying and yang. From this project of mine I also made a model.\" Once the model of the Tancici Dum had been completed, Mr Milunic (with the financial backing of the Dutch company Nationale Nederlanden) started looking for an internationally-renowned architect to collaborate with. The first choice was French architect Jean Nouvel, who later designed the Zlaty Andel building in Prague 5. \"First we asked Jean Nouvel, but he refused, because he said we only had 500 square metres and that's not enough for two architects. We contacted Frank Gehry, and when Frank saw my beginning, my sketches, he promised to collaborate with me on this project. From that time, the first meeting was in '92 in Geneva, to the finish of the building in '96 we made a nice building with Dutch money.\" Frank Gehry is probably the world's most famous architect at the moment - how was he to work with? \"It was perfect. And the thing about Frank is he never has a co-author. I am the first to be the co-author of one of his building. Also, this building was the testing point for the Guggenheim Museum.\" The Dancing Building, which Frank Gehry and Vlado Milunic have described as \"new Baroque\", has divided opinion probably more than any other modern construction in Prague. Though the city is already a hodgepodge of architectural styles, its opponents say the Dancing Building stands out like a sore thumb. Mr Milunic says, however, that most Praguers like it. \"It's controversial for some people, not for everybody. Because the citizens of Prague accept this building. Sixty-eight percent of people like this building and only 16 percent don't like it. That's positive, because we expected fifty-fifty.\" And, whatever about the objections of some preservationists during the planning stages, the Dancing Building project had friends in high places. \"My good friend was the director of the institute for the protection of monuments, the city architect was for the building, the investor wanted to build a nice building with a nice budget. We basically had no problems.\" Is it the case that the façade was designed to age quickly, to get older looking quickly? \"Many people ask why the building isn't painted. But Frank Gehry and I decided that we would use the natural colour of the materials. The glass is green, the concrete is grey, the stainless steel construction is argent. We say the building is so crazy that if we painted it, it would be a problem.\" In the beginning it was more commonly known as the Fred and Ginger Building, now everyone seems to call it the Dancing Building- did the Fred and Ginger name just disappear? \"That was Frank's idea but then he was afraid to import American Hollywood kitsch to Prague, though we said Fred and Ginger were artists. But in Prague many people call it the Dancing Building because it's more abstract. I call this building the Dancing Building because it's a dance after the Velvet Revolution.\" Author: Ian Willoughby run audio related articles Vlado Milunic, designer of Prague’s iconic Dancing House, has died play play Václav Havel’s Prague – a guided tour play play Is there a future for new skyscrapers in Prague? play play Vlado Milunic - Master of the Dancing House featured Let’s Protect Prague’s Nights: White light turns darkness into day 70 years of Bohuslav Martinů’s cantata &#039;The Opening of the Wells&#039; Jan Lipavský on war, security and alliances: Czech foreign policy under pressure follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram RSS most popular Netflix shooting The Age of Innocence in Prague play play Remembering Jan Palach: 57 years since his self-immolation Northern lights brightened Czech skies Shooting at municipal office in North Bohemia leaves two dead, six injured",

The project comes from the drawing board of world-renowned architects Vlado Milunić and Frank O. Gehry. Its concept was inspired by the dance skills of the famous film couple — the stone tower symbolizes Fred Astaire and the glass tower, his partner Ginger Rogers. A gallery and a restaurant with a terrace offering a 360° view of Prague can be visited in the Dancing House. Source: Prague City Tourism history The Dancing house was built in the years 1992—1996. The house that stood there before was destroyed during the American air bombing of Prague on the 14th February of 1945. In 1992 the land was bought by the Netherlander insurance company Nationale Nederlanden. They selected the building project from the architect Vlado Milunic and the worldwide acknowledged architect and designer Frank O. Gehry was invited to cooperate. This co-operation gave birth to a unique deconstructive building with plastic elements, which at the same time harmonizes with the surrounding buildings. It is one of the few Prague houses that dynamically enters the space of the street. The building is metaphorically called the Dancing House or also Ginger and Fred. It is named this way because of the towers reminding of the famous dancers Ginger Rogers and Fred Astair. The male part of the dancing couple is represented by a rock tower and the woman is symbolized by a tower made of glass. The top of the male tower is covered with imaginary hair. The author is Frank O. Gehry. The interiors were partly designed by the British architect of Czech provenience Eva Jiřičná. Nowadays, there are hotel in the building, gallery and a luxury restaurant with a terrace and a beautiful view.The building was awarded the prestige prize of the American Time magazine — it won the category of design in 1996. show more --> load the map Dancing House route Address Rašínovo nábřeží 80 / Jiráskovo náměstí 6, 120 00, Nové Město, Praha 2 related places western europe Ginger & Fred restaurant (Dancing House) Nové Město galleries Dancing House Gallery Nové Město get periodical news and tips about what’s on in prague Zadaný e-mail má špatný formát * by sending, you consent to the privacy policy subscribe select newsletter type Newsletter for visitors en de cz Newsletter for professionals en cz confirm subscription added to cart continue shopping to cart to order add to favourites to use this feature, log in to your user account log in create an account contact form --> Kontaktní formulář EN First Name Last Name E-mail Subject Text I have read and agree to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy Submit Form dates show more tour detail dates event detail share sdílejte stránku se svými přáteli nebo zkopírujte odkaz Smazat logy Zavřít",

Two floors that had previously been used as an art gallery were converted over five months into hotel rooms that offer views of Prague Castle or the Vltava River. The rooms are aimed at a foreign clientele. The hotel is operated by Luxury Suites s.r.o. and one of five owners is football star Vladimír Šmicer , who played for Czech team Slavia Praha as well as RC Lens, Liverpool F.C. and FC Girondins de Bordeaux. He was also the first overnight guest in the hotel. The Dancing House, one of Prague's modern landmarks located on Rašínovo nábřeží,celebrated its 20th anniversary this year. It was designed in 1992 by Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić working with Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry. The “new baroque” or deconstructivist-style building was completed in 1996. Václav Havel, then president of Czechoslovakia, was instrumental in getting the project started. The lot had been empty since the end of World War II, when a residential building that had been there was destroyed in an air raid. The Havel family owned a building adjacent to the empty lot. Václav Havel had long hoped to build a cultural center on the site. The building is sometimes called the Fred and Ginger Building after Hollywood screen dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The static and dynamic parts are meant to represent a society undergoing change. The official opening of Dancing House Hotel was Sept. 20, but the hotel had already been running in a test mode to fine tune details. “The highlight for guests are apartments in the towers named the Ginger Royal Suite and Fred Royal Suite, which offer direct views of Prague Castle. All rooms are double and can have extra beds, and some rooms can be connected. Reviews and testimonials have been very positive, with most guests singing the praises to our Dreambeds brand beds,” hotel manager Ivana Peterková said. “The hotel offers full service including the classic 24-hour reception. For breakfast with a view, guests can relax in the Ginger & Fred restaurant, located on the seventh floor. We also cooperate with Glass Bar and the art gallery. Dancing House works in a unified manner, although its services are operated by several subjects,” Peterková added. The Glass Bar on the eighth floor offers views of the city on an outdoor terrace. The Dancing House Gallery now occupies the entry level and lower level of the building. Some of the rooms such as the Ginger Suite and Ginger Royal Suite have floor to ceiling curved glass windows, while others like the Fred Deluxe Room and Fred Royal Suite have more traditional windows, depending on which part of the building the room is in. The hotel may be expanded to more floors in the future. Investor Václav Skala bought the Dancing House in 2013 and has been transforming it from being solely offices to finally meeting the original concept of Havel and the architects, which was to have a multifunctional space with cultural events and public access.

A l Jazeera pushed back Wednesday against Republican efforts to force the Qatar-based media outlet to register as a foreign agent. Six GOP senators and two GOP representatives sent a letter to the Justice Department on Wednesday asking the Department of Justice to review whether the network should register as a foreign agent, alleging “Al Jazeera is a messaging tool for the Qatari government” and asking the DOJ to take action in enforcing the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Al Jazeera Media Network responded in a statement to the Washington Examiner , claiming that Al Jazeera “is not owned by Qatar” and that “its reporting is not directed or controlled by the Qatari government nor does it reflect any government viewpoint.” “Therefore, FARA registration is not required,” Al Jazeera said. The state-funded media company based in Doha, Qatar, reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world through its websites, Arab-language stations, satellite channel, and growing digital efforts. Although Al Jazeera America recently shut down, the network's most ambitious recent endeavor, Al Jazeera Plus, features online articles on Medium and sleek viral videos on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. AJ+ is based in the United States with headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Jazeera, with its funding from the oil-rich Gulf nation, has long faced questions if it should register as an agent of a foreign power under federal law, which requires anyone who is working on behalf of a foreign government — whether a lobbyist, a business, a K Street firm, or a media outlet — to disclose this relationship by registering with the DOJ. Lawmakers said today that there are reports of “activities in which Al Jazeera Media Network is engaged that raise legitimate questions about whether it should register as a foreign agent.” The lawmakers also pointed out that Al Jazeera “is a state-owned enterprise” and that “the Qatari government has provided the majority of its funding.” Al Jazeera told the Washington Examiner that the outlet operates with editorial independence while receiving public funding, similar to global media organizations such as the British Broadcasting Company, among others. “Given that members of the ruling family are in charge of managing the media network, it is more likely than not that the government can and will assert editorial control over media content,” the lawmakers surmised today. “The network frequently features content promoting the apparent policy priorities of its owner.” The letter pointed to a number of examples of what they saw as Qatari influence over the media outlet, including Al Jazeera’s reported support for and favorable coverage of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group backed by the government of Qatar. They also pointed out that Qatar allows Hamas members to operate in the country while Al Jazeera hosts Hamas leaders on their shows. The lawmakers also claimed that videos on on AJ+ “appear to support anti-Israeli and anti-American positions.” In their Wednesday letter, the six senators (Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas) and the two congressmen (Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y.) asserted that evidence suggests that Al Jazeera “has engaged in inherently political activities and sought to influence public opinion in the United States” on behalf of Qatar and thus should comply with FARA. Originally passed during the World War II era to combat Nazi propaganda efforts, the rarely prosecuted FARA law gained new attention recently after Mueller secured foreign agent convictions against Trump associates like Paul Manafort and Rick Gates during his investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 campaign. Russia-backed outlets such as Russia Today, Sputnik, and RM Broadcasting were forced to register under FARA in recent years. And the U.S. has also stepped up the pressure on Chinese state media operating in the U.S. — the China Global Television Network registered in 2019, although Xinhua News Agency has reportedly thus far declined to do so . The DOJ has vowed to step up its FARA enforcement , with Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey of the National Security Division stressing that “the statute is really smart and really good” in combating “this problem of malign foreign influence.” Lawmakers also said Al Jazeera “has engaged in inherently political activities and sought to influence public opinion in the United States” on behalf of Qatar and works as an “alter ego of the Qatari government.” Al Jazeera told the Washington Examiner that the content for its AJ+ English operation is created by a young, diverse staff, none of whom are Qataris, and that AJ+ employees report to U.S.-based managers. The network also said that its content sometimes runs counter to societal norms and policies of Qatar, and is critical of Qatar and, which shows it is “is independent and audience-driven.” Republicans pointed to former Al Jazeera English Egypt bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy , who has said Al Jazeera English “coordinated and took directives from Qatar’s government” and the more it did so, the more it becomes a mouthpiece for Qatari intelligence.” Al Jazeera has not been without recent controversy. In May, it removed a Holocaust denial conspiracy video from its AJ+ platforms, saying that it “completely disowns the offensive content in question.” Latest Michigan Republicans clash over future of party as campaigns struggle to win over donors By: Rachel Schilke Amy Coney Barrett welcomes public scrutiny of Supreme Court: &#x27;I&#x27;ve acquired a thick skin&#x27; By: Kaelan Deese Food stamps: September SNAP payments worth up to $2,145 to arrive in four states in three days By: Rachel Schilke Videos Boosters, fencers, and cleaners: Inside cartels&#x27; newest criminal enterprise of organized retail theft AMA paper on uterus transplants for men sparks petition drive: &#x27;Remember your oath&#x27; Meadows hearing ends without ruling after hours of testimony in Georgia RICO case CTE degenerative brain disorder found in amateur contact sports players: NIH Newsletters Sign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.

Al-Jazeera was launched in 1996, and enjoys tremendous popularity throughout the region for its news reporting and hard-hitting talk shows from an Arab perspective. The diversity of opinions aired on Jazeera stands in sharp contrast to the state-controlled and censored media that exists in many parts of the region. In the weeks following the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington al-Jazeera has repeatedly broadcast its 1998 interview with Oussama bin Laden, hosted commentators critical of U.S. policy, and since September 19 has been the only station with correspondents reporting from the area of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban. Since September 2000, it has also intensively covered the second Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation. The station has also been periodically criticized by governments in the region -- including Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Morocco -- for giving air time to dissidents and discussing sensitive issues censored in national media. Al-Jazeera has long stated that its current affairs programming is designed to \"offer a platform for divergent viewpoints and analyses.\" Qatar's head of state of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah al-Thani, told journalists in Washington on October 3 that the Bush administration, as well as the Clinton administration before it, had complained to the Qatari government about some of Jazeera's programming, which U.S. officials reportedly view as lacking balance and sometimes inaccurate. The emir noted that the station has also been criticized by \"so many heads of other states,\" but that the government's plans for a parliamentary democracy \"dictates that freedom of the press should be granted.\" CNN also confirmed on October 3 the U.S. pressure on Qatar. Citing unnamed State Department officials, it reported that the Bush administration believes al-Jazeera is \"unbalanced and encourages anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.\" It said that during the week of September 24 the U.S. ambassador to Qatar, Maureen Quinn, delivered a formal protest to the Qatari foreign minister about the station's broadcasts. \"We are getting hammered in the Arab world,\" one State Department official told CNN. \"Many feel that al-Jazeera is trying to run the divide and fuel the flames of fundamentalism.\" Another senior official said that the October 3 meeting in Washington between Secretary of State Colin Powell and Qatar's emir was a \"frank exchange,\" adding: \"There should have been no mistake of where we are coming from.\" The station's managing director, Muhamed Jasim al-Ali, defended its programming on October 4. \"These accusations are not strange,\" he told the Reuters news agency. \"We have been accused of being the voice of Iraq because of our coverage, and now as we are the only people with access in Afghanistan, we're accused of being pro-Afghani. We have correspondents in the United States and we have correspondents in Kabul and Kandahar. We give equal coverage to both sides and that is our role. We present both sides.\" Al-Jazeera began operations with millions of dollars in funding from the Qatari government. It is not yet financially independent but is considered a private company, not a government station. Its staff reportedly includes some 350 editors, anchors and technicians, and about thirty foreign correspondents. Al-Jazeera broadcasts around the clock, with its news coverage complemented by programs on finance, culture, religion and sports. The station is received throughout the Middle East, including Israel, and in Europe and the Americas.",

Originally an Arabic-language outlet, it aimed to provide an independent and non-Western perspective on news, particularly from the Arab world. The network emerged from a failed joint venture between the BBC and Saudi Arabia, allowing it to prioritize editorial independence and tackle topics often previously censored in state-owned media. Al Jazeera is known for its willingness to critique governments in the region, which helped it quickly gain a substantial audience. While it has been praised for its objective reporting, particularly in comparison to other regional broadcasts, Al Jazeera has faced criticism, particularly from Western governments, for its coverage of events such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The network gained international notoriety for broadcasting videos from Al Qaeda, leading to perceptions of it being sympathetic to extremist views, a characterization it has contested. Over the years, Al Jazeera has expanded its reach with regional and international channels, including Al Jazeera English, and continues to produce a wide range of news and cultural programming, reaching hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide.

Al Jazeera TV Summary: Al Jazeera is a prominent news network operated by the Al Jazeera Media Network, which is a private media conglomerate funded in part by the government of Qatar. It is widely regarded as an objective competitor of such Western outlets as the BBC and CNN , even though it came under harsh criticism from the US government for its coverage of the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq. The network was founded in 1996 after a nascent joint venture between the BBC and Saudi Arabia collapsed in a dispute over censorship. Since then, Al Jazeera has become a worldwide news source. Founded: 1996. Based in: Doha, Qatar. Founder: Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, Emir of Qatar Chairperson: Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani Availability: Worldwide The Al Jazeera television network (the name means the peninsula, referring to the Arabian Peninsula) was founded in 1996 as an Arabic-language news network designed to provide a non-Western news source. It was funded by the emir of Qatar, and it is still receiving funding from the government of Qatar. In the West, Al Jazeera became known as the preferred outlet for videos produced by Al Qaeda &#x2014;most famously, video statements by Osama bin Laden &#x2014;and was sometimes denounced as an Islamist or Al Qaeda propaganda network. Its origins and purpose are quite different. In 1995, the BBC and Orbit Communications, owned by Saudi Arabia, launched a joint venture to provide news coverage of the Middle East. The venture was short-lived, however, since the BBC demanded editorial independence and the Saudis insisted on exercising editorial control, including censorship. Consequently, Orbit Communications withdrew from the venture in April 1996. Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, emir of Qatar in the Gulf, stepped in to replace the Saudis, promising to allow Al Jazeera to \"report the news as they see it.\" Many BBC World Service employees assigned to the original BBC-Orbit venture joined Al Jazeera, and the new iteration of Al Jazeera began broadcasting in November 1996. The ownership of the emir of Qatar almost instantly gave Al Jazeera a degree of credibility in the region, since it was the first television news network in the Middle East not controlled by a Western corporation and not run as an arm of an Arab government. From the outset, Al Jazeera provided the Arab-speaking world news coverage judged by most analysts to be objective and balanced, at least in comparison to the previous state-owned broadcasts. Al Jazeera also was willing to break the previous taboo against criticizing other Arab governments. The network's founder and financial backer declared: \"I believe criticism can be a good thing, and some discomfort for government officials is a small price to pay for this new freedom.\" It was a new attitude for Arabic television news, and the network quickly gained a large audience. The network adopted as its motto: \"The opinion and the other opinion.\" Al Jazeera's position enabled it to enjoy a certain privileged position. During the period of Taliban control of Afghanistan prior to the US invasion of 2001 , for example, Al Jazeera was the only television news network with offices in the Afghan capital. In 2011, Al Jazeera became a self-described private corporation for public benefit, allowing the network to receive funding from the Qatar Council of Ministers, which nominates Al Jazeera&#x2019;s leaders, who the ruler of Qatar then appoints. This is often referred to as the network&#x2019;s second launch, which allowed the network to become a private media company while still influenced by the Qatari government.&#xA0; Al Jazeera and bin Laden Most Westerners were unaware of the existence of Al Jazeera and Osama bin Laden before the September 11, 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Afterward, Al Jazeera became the main link between Western news outlets and Al Qaeda's video and audio tapes. Because Al Jazeera was an Arab news outlet, it was chosen to receive videotapes produced by Al Qaeda to spread the message and viewpoint of Osama bin Laden. Even though the news coverage produced by Al Jazeera showed no affinity for the Islamist viewpoint, the fact that Al Jazeera broadcast these tapes caused a widespread perception in the West that it was a tool of Al Qaeda. Over time, Al Qaeda built an alternative distribution method to eliminate the dangers associated with delivering video and audio tapes to Al Jazeera and address its inability to control when, in what form, or even whether its material would be broadcast. Al Qaeda's increasingly sophisticated video production unit, named As-Sahab, switched to distribution over the Internet. Nevertheless, Al Jazeera's willingness to broadcast Al Qaeda tapes without editing generated distrust and even disgust in the United States (US), where such broadcasts were viewed as sympathetic acts of propaganda. Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once remarked that Al Jazeera was a \"mouthpiece of Al Qaeda\" and denounced its news coverage as \"vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable.\" In November 2001, a US bomb hit the office of Al Jazeera's correspondent in Kabul, Afghanistan. The network accused the Pentagon of deliberating targeting the office; the US denied this was the case. At the beginning of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, both the US and the government of Saddam Hussein were highly critical of Al Jazeera's coverage of the conflict, and both sides were eager for more favorable treatment. Al Jazeera correspondents were repeatedly subjected to American \"investigations\"&#x2014;including the detention of at least two of its reporters, Suheib Badr Darwish and Salah Hassan, in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, where they were subjected to harsh treatment and interrogation. Both men were released without charges being filed. On the other hand, Rumsfeld, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, and then-Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain granted Al Jazeera exclusive interviews, viewing the network as a window into the Arab world. The Case of Tayseer Allouni In 2003, an Al Jazeera news anchor, Tayseer Allouni, was jailed in Spain while police investigated charges that he was a member of Al Qaeda who had recruited new members and shared information with members of an Al Qaeda cell in Spain. He was also accused of using a journalistic assignment in Afghanistan to transfer funds to Al Qaeda. Allouni's lawyer denied the charges, insisting the journalist's dealings with Al Qaeda were only related to his reporting for Al Jazeera. Allouni had previously gained notoriety for interviewing bin Laden before 9/11. Two years after his arrest, Allouni&#x2014;who held a Spanish passport&#x2014;was convicted of collaborating with Al Qaeda. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. In 2006 a Spanish court ruled that Allouni could serve the balance of his sentence under house arrest. What's On By 2007, nearly ten years after its first broadcast, Al Jazeera claimed over 40 million viewers worldwide. In addition to 24-hour news coverage, Al Jazeera programming included a documentary, sports, and children's channels. It produced a variety of popular \"talk\" programs, including Cultural Forum , which featured prominent artists from the performing and fine arts; For Women Only , which showcased accomplished women; Al Jazeera Platform , which tackled Arab issues with audience participation; More Than One Opinion , an interactive political discussion; and Open Dialogue , where famous guests answered questions from the audience. Such live, interactive programming entirely outside the reach of government, long a familiar staple in the West, was an innovation in the Arab world. By the mid-2020s, Al Jazeera continued to reach an impressive number of viewers worldwide. The channel was broadcast to over 430 million homes in over 150 countries. Al Jazeera continued producing original programming, including Inside Story , The Stream , Al Jazeera Investigates , and Empire . The network also produced documentary series such as 101 East . Al Jazeera English and Other Ventures In 1996, Al Jazeera launched an English-language channel. The network recruited several well-known figures from Western television, including David Frost of Great Britain and former US network correspondent Dave Marash. In its first year, Al Jazeera achieved limited distribution in the US, but its broadcasts became available through video streaming over the Internet. In 2013, the company launched the television channel Al Jazeera America. However, the channel closed in 2016 after executives cited an unsustainable business model. In some instances, Al Jazeera English competed directly with American counterparts, such as CNN, for distribution via foreign cable television systems, including the largest cable operator in Israel. According to the company's website, in 2023, Al Jazeera English has been broadcasted to more than 300 million households across 140 countries.

Journalists had produced a package of the UN debate, topped with excerpts of President Obama&#x27;s speech, last Tuesday when a last-minute instruction came from Salah Negm, the Qatar-based news director, who ordered the video to be re-edited to lead with the comments from Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. Despite protests from staff that the emir&#x27;s comments – a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention in Syria – were not the most important aspect of the UN debate, the two-minute video was re-edited and Obama&#x27;s speech was relegated to the end of the package. There are hints at staff dissatisfaction within the film, available for viewing on al-Jazeera&#x27;s website and YouTube, which notes that the emir &quot;represents one of the smallest countries in the Arab world … but Qatar has been one of the loudest voices condemning Syria&quot;. The episode left a bitter taste among staff amid complaints that this was the most heavy-handed editorial intervention at the global broadcaster, which has long described itself as operating independent of its Qatari ownership. An al-Jazeera spokesman said the emir&#x27;s speech was &quot;a significant development&quot; that day and the broadcaster &quot;consequently gave it prominence&quot;. Obama&#x27;s speech had been carried live, the spokesman added, and the emir&#x27;s comments were balanced with disagreement from the Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi. However, insiders said Morsi&#x27;s contribution had to be taken from an interview with another broadcaster, because none of the world leaders speaking at the UN had, or was, intending to take notice of the emir&#x27;s comments. Al-Jazeera English was set up in 2006 by the Arabic broadcaster of the same name and both are owned by the Qatari state. The network, founded in 1996, gained credibility with audiences in the region for its seemingly independent coverage in the post 9/11 period. Its English channel was launched to offer an alternative, non-western-centric worldview. However, in recent years, Qatar has taken steps to consolidate its control over the channel as the country seeks greater political influence in the Gulf. In September 2011, Wadah Khanfar, a Palestinian widely seen as independent, suddenly left as director-general after eight years in the post and was replaced by a member of the royal family, Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim al-Thani, a man with no background in journalism. In his resignation letter, Khanfar said, after noting that the channel had been criticised by Donald Rumsfeld and hailed by Hillary Clinton, that &quot;al-Jazeera is still independent and its integral coverage has not changed&quot;. He added: &quot;When we launched in 1996, media independence was a contradiction in terms&quot;, but al-Jazeera had managed &quot;to pleasantly surprise&quot; its critics by &quot;exceeding all expectations&quot;.

    "source_text": "Al-Jazeera has fans in Obama W.H. - POLITICO Skip to Main Content Al-Jazeera has fans in Obama W.H. Al Jazeera's coverage of uprisings across the Middle East has raised its standing in the W.H. By Keach Hagey and Byron Tau 04/17/2011 04:31 PM EDT Updated: 04/18/2011 01:10 PM EDT In the halls of American power, the Arab Spring has brought Al-Jazeera in from the cold. Seven years after then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called the broadcaster’s reporting “vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable” and President George W. Bush joked about bombing it, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised it as “real news” in her recent Senate testimony. Not only that, her staffers, as well as those of the CIA and the Obama White House, were attending the Congressional Correspondents’ Dinner as Al-Jazeera’s guests. “They are a really important media entity, and we have a really great relationship with them,” said Dana Shell Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for international media engagement, who speaks Arabic and has frequently appeared on the channel. “This administration has empowered those of us who actually do the communicating to be in a close relationship with Al-Jazeera. They understand that the relationship can’t consist of complaining to each other about the differences we have.” The differences also have shrunk as the big story in the Middle East has shifted from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the democratic movements sweeping the region. In the recent uprisings, U.S. interests tended to line up with Al-Jazeera’s, and President Barack Obama alluded to both the network’s influence and its pro-democracy bent in remarks caught on an open mic during a closed-door fundraiser last week. “The emir of Qatar come by the Oval Office today, and he owns Al-Jazeera basically,” Obama said in remarks recorded by CBS News’s Mark Knoller. “Pretty influential guy. He is a big booster, big promoter of democracy all throughout the Middle East. Reform, reform, reform. You’re seeing it on Al-Jazeera.” But even an in an Al-Jazeera-friendly Obama administration there are tensions. The president continued, delivering some harsh criticism that conflicted directly with his diplomatic comments earlier in the day, when he had praised the emir for his leadership “when it comes to democracy in the Middle East.” “He himself is not reforming significantly,” the president told the donors. “There is no big move towards democracy in Qatar.” But even if the president thinks Al-Jazeera’s Qatari owners might have a blind spot, his remarks before an audience of the rich and powerful reflected how recent events in the Middle East and North Africa have accelerated the shift of Al-Jazeera’s brand from “anti-American” to “pro-democracy” in the American consciousness. “It’s like Rip Van Winkle — you wake up and, my God, it’s a different world,” said Tony Burman, Al Jazeera English’s chief strategic adviser for the Americas. “Hosni Mubarak did in 18 days what I thought it would take two years to do.” Burman, a former editor in chief of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News, served as managing director of AJE in Doha before coming to Washington last fall to take on his new strategic role that includes helping get AJE the national cable and satellite distribution it still lacks in the U.S. When he arrived, he could never have guessed that within a few months, protests would erupt across Al-Jazeera’s backyard and that its reporters would be there on the ground to cover them, often before anyone else, making his case for him. “In the autumn, I met many people in the political and media realm here in Washington, and in New York City as well, and it was still, at that point, a lot of curiosity of Al-Jazeera, but not much understanding of it,” he said. “Now, almost overnight, the situation has changed. The impact and importance of Al-Jazeera seems to be visible to all, particularly people in Washington.” Today, when he visits the White House, officials tell him they watch AJE to monitor the protests, and at the State Department, “when you go down the hallway, you see it on virtually every TV and computer.” The channel’s coverage of Tunisia and Egypt, in particular, and the 2,500 percent surge in traffic to the broadcaster’s website that they caused at their peak — 60 percent of it from within the U.S. — has prompted scores of glowing newspaper profiles, with The New York Times going so far as to press 10 cable providers for comment about whether they would consider carrying it. (Right now, the channel is only available in a handful of American cities, including Washington, D.C., via the nonprofit broadcaster MHz Networks.) Recognizing an opportunity, AJE began running full-page newspaper ads touting testimonials from its fans, in hopes of inspiring cable and satellite customers to nag their providers about adding the channel. To date, more than 50,000 of them have obliged, Burman said. Students and activists unaffiliated with the channel took up AJE’s campaign for cable and satellite carriage as a kind of political cause, organizing a national call-in day and setting up a Demand Al Jazeera Facebook page . All of this scares the living daylights out of Cliff Kincaid, director of the Accuracy in Media Center for Investigative Reporting and president of America’s Survival, who organized a “Stop Al Jazeera”conference at the National Press Club in Washington earlier this month. Kincaid said he organized the event — headlined by Pamela Geller, the blogger best known for breathing life into the so-called ground zero mosque story — in part, to counter the campaign to get AJE wider distribution throughout the U.S. and in part, to put pressure on Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) to include an investigation into Al-Jazeera as part of his House Homeland Security Committee hearings on homegrown Muslim radicalization. “To Comcast, and other cable and satellite providers, we say, do not expand Al-Jazeera throughout the U.S. Otherwise you will increase the chances of Americans being killed by those manipulated by ‘Jihad TV,’ the terrorist network, and you, Comcast, will have blood on your hands,” Kincaid told an audience of about 30 at the press club. Kincaid pointed to a statement by Judea Pearl, father of the slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who called Al-Jazeera “the most powerful voice of the Muslim Brotherhood.” Kincaid has been one of the most consistent voices raising concerns about AJE’s spread into the U.S. since the channel’s inception in 2006. Both organizations that he is associated with, AIM and America’s Survival, have received some of their biggest grants from foundations controlled by billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, an investor in the conservative Newsmax magazine and the owner of the right-leaning Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Scaife’s foundations have also funded David Horowitz’s nonprofit, which has sponsored aggressive scrutiny of American Islam. So far, neither Comcast nor King’s office has gotten back to Kincaid on his requests. A Comcast spokeswoman told POLITICO only, “We do not have a carriage agreement with Al Jazeera English,” though AJE programming does air on Comcast in the Washington market through MHz Networks. Kincaid said he met with King and Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) seeking an investigation into, among other things, “the activities of foreign propaganda channels Al-Jazeera, Russia Today television and Iranian Press TV on American soil.” King’s chief of staff Kevin Fogarty said that “no hearing is planned” and declined to comment further. Gingrey’s office confirmed that the meeting took place, but declined to comment about Al-Jazeera. In fact, few Republicans seem to have an appetite for criticizing Al-Jazeera at the moment. Even Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.), the one Republican who was willing to speak to his concerns about AJE’s possible expansion in the U.S., framed his fears in the conditional. “Dr. Broun has misgivings about an increased presence of Al Jazeera English in the United States,” his spokeswoman, Meredith Griffanti, told POLITICO. “If Al Jazeera English hopes to establish itself more so on American soil, it must prove to the United States that their intentions are primarily improving our relations with the Middle East — rather than promoting anti-American rhetoric.” Al-Jazeera’s brand problems in the U.S. were set in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, when the Arabic channel owned by the Qatari government ran video tapes of Osama bin Laden before anyone else got them, and its critical coverage of the Iraq War made it deeply unpopular with the Pentagon. By 2005, the Bush administration’s displeasure with Al-Jazeera was so intense that it was straining the U.S.’s relationship with Qatar, an important ally in the region, and Qatari officials were considering selling off the station, The New York Times reported . That same year, Qatar hired Barbour Griffith & Rogers, the lobbying and public relations firm founded by Haley Barbour, on a $300,000 contract to improve relations with the Bush administration, according to O‘Dwyer’s PR Daily. A person familiar with the Qatar contact confirmed to POLITICO that BGR and Al-Jazeera have a long-standing relationship, and that the network embarked on a PR push during the latter half of the Bush administration. “The PR campaign, to a certain degree, was successful,” said Suhail Khan, who served in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Bush administration. “They just began booking Republican guests.” AJE’s leadership had high hopes that Obama’s inauguration would begin a new era of relations with the U.S., but his decision to give his first interview to Al Arabiya, its Saudi-owned rival, reflected ongoing uneasiness with the Al-Jazeera brand. “When President Obama can out, the first network he spoke to was Al Arabiya because of a bit of an allergy that I think was wrong,” said Steve Clemons, founder of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation, who recently participated in the Al-Jazeera Centre’s three-day forum in Doha. The Arab Spring has done more to change that than anything else to date. “There has been a switch on the perception of Al Jazeera Arabic, simply because right now, the U.S. and Al Jazeera Arabic are more aligned in backing the democracy movements,” said Marc Lynch, associate professor of political science and international affairs at The George Washington University and blogger at Foreign Policy, who was also at the forum. “It’s not like Al-Jazeera or the U.S. have changed that much. The issues have changed.” Additional reporting by Kenneth P. Vogel. CLARIFICATION: Accuracy in Media has not received funding from one of Richard Scaife’s foundations since 2005.

He attended grammar school at Market Bosworth, a tiny nearby town, and went on to Cambridge University, where he received his BA in 1608 and his MA in 1611. While a student at Cambridge, Thomas Hooker underwent a profound religious experience and decided to become a minister. Such conversion experiences were central to the beliefs of the Puritans , a Protestant sect that arose within the Church of England during the late 16th century. Puritans believed that in the process of conversion, they directly experienced the wrath and love of God. Unlike other, more radical sects, however, they sought to remain within the Anglican Church and to reform it from within. Emmanuel College at Cambridge, which Hooker attended, was a hotbed of Puritanism. Hooker became a powerful and popular preacher, attracting a large following. He served first in a small village church just outside London and later in the large market town of Chelmsford. A neighboring vicar denounced him to William Laud, the Anglican Bishop of London and an ardent opponent of Puritanism. Ordered to abandon his practices and beliefs, Hooker resigned his position in Chelmsford and took a job as schoolmaster in yet another small village. This did not end the threat of prosecution, however, and he eventually fled to Holland where there was already a large community of Puritan exiles. Finally, in 1633, he decided to immigrate to America. On July 10, he and his family sailed for Boston on the Griffin with a large group of Puritans, including John Cotton, another prominent Puritan minister. Thomas Hooker Arrives in North America Founded in 1630 as a Puritan stronghold, Boston was still a raw new town on the edge of the wilderness. John Cotton assumed the role of its leading minister. Thomas Hooker served as minister to the citizens of nearby Newtown, a settlement on the opposite side of the Charles River that later became Cambridge. Almost immediately, Hooker’s congregation began seeking to escape the Boston area and the influence of John Cotton. They began looking westward to the Connecticut River Valley, petitioning the General Court for permission to move there. Samuel E. Brown, Mr. Hooker and his Congregation travelling through the Wilderness , 1998.152.86 – Connecticut Historical Society In June 1636, less than three years after Thomas Hooker arrived in Boston, he and one hundred members of his congregation set off on the two-week overland journey , accompanied by 160 head of cattle, goats, and pigs. They followed a Native American trail, later known as the Connecticut Path or the Bay Path, west to the Connecticut River and then south to the future site of Hartford . There was already a scattering of settlements in the Connecticut Valley when Hooker and his congregation arrived there. The party passed indigenous villages as they made their way along the Connecticut Path, and encountered a small group of English settlers in Windsor , as they traveled south along the river. There was a Dutch fort at the mouth of the Little River (later the Park River) immediately to the south of Hartford, and another small group of English settlers in Wethersfield , immediately south of that. Throughout the 1630s, English settlers continued to arrive, most of them making the long overland trek from Boston. Spreading Puritanism in Hartford As minister of the church in Hartford, Hooker enjoyed enormous influence. At first the river settlements functioned as an adjunct of Boston, governed by eight magistrates appointed by the Massachusetts General Court, but this was clearly not an acceptable long-term solution. In 1638, Hooker preached a sermon on the text, “Choose men of wisdom, understanding, and repute…and [the Lord] will set them in authority over you,” arguing that the people of Connecticut had the right to choose their own government. This sermon served as inspiration for the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut , which established a civil government and assured the existence of Connecticut as a separate colony, independent from Massachusetts. The Fundamental Orders served as the legal basis for the Connecticut Colony until Charles II granted it a formal charter in 1662 .

The replicas were constructed on the state capitol grounds for the Connecticut Tercentenary Celebration, 1935 &#8211; Connecticut State Library and Connecticut History Illustrated Not only was Hooker one of the leading figures in the Connecticut Colony; he was also one of the leading Puritan theologians in New England. He took part in the trials of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson and in several church councils. His book, A Survey of the Summe of Church-Discipline , is considered one of the best expositions of Puritan church doctrine. Sadly, Hooker did not live to see it published. The ship carrying his original manuscript to England for printing sank and Hooker died before completing a second draft—succumbing during an epidemic in the summer of 1647. His book finally met with publication, in London, the following year. Cotton Mather, the grandson of his old rival John Mather, praised him as “the light of the Western churches.” Another contemporary called him “that great Elijah, that renowned man of faith.” His trek to Hartford was the symbolic beginning of America’s westward expansion, and his principles (stated in A Survey of the Summe of Church-Discipline and in his numerous sermons) not only supported the dominance of the Puritan church in succeeding centuries but also provided a tentative basis for American democracy.

The name “Charter Oak” came from local legend and a much-told Connecticut tale in which a hollow space in the tree was used to hide the colony’s charter. The tree’s history does not begin with the hiding of the colony’s charter, however. Long before white settlers came to the colony, generations of Native Americans held their councils beneath its massive branches, and during his European voyage up the Connecticut River , Adriaen Block was so impressed with the tree that he took note of it in the journey’s logbook. The land on which the tree stood was eventually purchased by Stephen Wyllys, one of Hartford’s first landowners. Tradition has it that while Wyllys cleared the land for his homestead and farming he was visited by a delegation of Indians who pleaded with him to not remove the great tree. Wyllys agreed and the tree stood for almost two centuries longer. The Charter Oak, taken the morning of its fall &#8211; Connecticut Historical Society and Connecticut History Online Following the days after the storm, the people of Connecticut formally mourned the tree, and pieces of its wood were treated as treasures: three chairs were carved out of its trunk, including one that is the ceremonial seat of the president of the State Senate, a frame that now contains the colony’s charter, as well as a number of other items which can be seen at the capitol building and the Connecticut Historical Society. In 1905, a monument was erected at the location of the fallen oak tree. It stands at the corner of Charter Oak Avenue and Charter Oak Place in Hartford’s downtown. The monument, a round column topped by a globe and supported by a base with four whales and sea shells reads, “Near this spot stood the Charter Oak, memorable in the history of the colony of Connecticut as the hiding place of the charter October 31, 1687. The tree fell August 21, 1856.” Today, the tree remains a symbol of Connecticut and has been pictorially represented in four paintings; two of which are in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art , and two of which are in the Connecticut Historical Society’s collections. In 1935, a three-cent U.S. postage stamp was issued depicting the tree, as well as the obverse of a commemorative half-dollar issued the same year. In 1999 the Charter Oak was chosen as Connecticut’s state symbol on the state quarter. Children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the Charter Oak exist all over the state of Connecticut.

James Madison ’s mercantile policies and the progress of the War of 1812 (“Mr. Madison’s War”), as well as long resentful over the balance of political power that gave the South, particularly Virginia , effective control of the national government. Satire of the Hartford Convention, secret meetings of Federalists that lasted from December 1814 to … Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (digital id: ppmsca 10755) The more extreme delegates raised the possibility of secession, but others sought only to dictate amendments to the Constitution that would protect their interests. Ultimately, the convention adopted a strong states’ rights position and expressed its grievances in a series of resolutions against military conscription and commercial regulations (along with some stringent criticisms of Madison’s administration) that were agreed to on January 4, 1815. Even as the convention finished its business, however, a British sloop of war was beating its way across the Atlantic with dispatches containing the peace terms that had been agreed to in the Treaty of Ghent , ending the war. Moreover, as the convention’s emissaries approached Washington, D.C. , they were met by the news of Gen. Andrew Jackson ’s unexpected victory in the Battle of New Orleans . By the time the emissaries arrived, it was no longer possible to serve the kind of ultimatum contained in the convention’s report. The war, along with the national crisis it had brought about, had ended. The secrecy of the Hartford proceedings also contributed to discrediting the convention, and its unpopularity was a factor in the demise of the Federalist Party.

Hartford Convention - Student Encyclopedia (Ages 11 and up) In U.S. history, a secret meeting of Federalist delegates during the War of 1812 was the Hartford Convention. The meeting was an outgrowth of anger in New England over the war. Many in New England believed that the war was unnecessary and that it was having a paralyzing effect on the economy. From December 15, 1814, to January 5, 1815, delegates from the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont gathered at Hartford, Connecticut, to discuss their grievances. In protest of President James Madison’s war policies, the convention adopted a strong states’ rights position. The convention was discredited with the arrival of news of peace after the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. The mere existence of the Hartford Convention caused other parts of the country to question New England’s patriotism and Federalist loyalty, spelling eventual doom for the Federalist Party.

At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer. View the web archive through the Wayback Machine . Collection: Wide Crawl started March 2011 Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011. This uses the new HQ software for distributed crawling by Kenji Nagahashi. What’s in the data set: Crawl start date: 09 March, 2011 Crawl end date: 23 December, 2011 Number of captures: 2,713,676,341 Number of unique URLs: 2,273,840,159 Number of hosts: 29,032,069 The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date. We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed. We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with.

TIMESTAMPS The Wayback Machine - https://web.archive.org/web/20110919182250/http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/72.htm Tamil Militant Groups Sri Lanka Table of Contents The de facto policies of preference that the Sri Lankan government adopted in order to assist the Sinhalese community in such areas as education and public employment affected most severely middle class Tamil youth, who found it more difficult during the 1970s and 1980s to enter a university or secure employment than had their older brothers and sisters. Individuals belonging to this younger generation, often referred to by other Tamils as &quot;the boys,&quot; formed the core of an extremist movement that had become, by the late 1980s, one of the world's most violent. By the end of 1987, they fought not only the Sri Lankan security forces but also the armed might of the (Indian Peacekeeping Force) and terrorized both Sinhalese and Tamil civilians with acts of random violence. They also fought among each other with equal if not greater brutality. In a sense, the militant movement was not only a revolt against the Sinhalese-dominated status quo but also an expression of intergenerational tensions in a highly traditional society where obedience to parental authority had long been sacrosanct. Militant youth criticized their elders for indecisiveness at a time when they felt the existence of their ethnic community clearly was in danger. The movement also reflected caste differences and rivalries. The membership of the largest and most important extremist group, for example, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was generally drawn from the Karava or fisherman caste, while individuals belonging to the elite Vellala caste were found in considerable numbers in a rival group, the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE, also PLOT). Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emerged in 1972 when Tamil youth espousing an independent Tamil state established a group called the Tamil New Tigers. At that time, the idea of secession was still considered radical by most Tamil leaders, though the TULF embraced it four years later. An incident of apparently unprovoked police brutality in 1974 started the LTTE on its career of insurgency. In January of that year, the World Tamil Research Conference, bringing delegates from many different countries, was held in Jaffna. Police seeing large crowds milling around the meeting hall attacked them ferociously. Nine persons were killed and many more injured. The incident was viewed by youthful militants not only as a provocative act of violence but as a deliberate insult to Tamil culture. It was, according to one Tamil spokesman, &quot;a direct challenge to their manhood.&quot; The Tigers' first act as an insurgent movement was to assassinate the progovernment mayor of Jaffna in 1975. Subsequently they went underground. As extremist movements in other countries have done, the LTTE apparently established contacts with similar groups, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, trained with Palestinians in Libya and Lebanon, and ran its own secret training camps in India's Tamil Nadu State. In 1988 Velupillai Prabhakaran, its undisputed military and political leader, and A.S. Balasingham, its ideological spokesman, were the LTTE's most important figures. The Tamil militants' choice of the tiger as their symbol reflected not only the ferocity of that animal but a deliberate contrast with the lion ( singha ), which traditionally has been a symbol of the Sinhalese people and is depicted in the Sri Lankan flag. Ideologically, LTTE theoreticians at times resorted to Marxist rhetoric to characterize their struggle. Overall, the creation of an independent Tamil state, irrespective of ideology, remained the movement's only goal. In pursuit of this objective, the LTTE seemed more wedded to direct and violent action than formulation of principles on which the independent state would operate. LTTE leader Prabhakaran maintained friendly, though watchful, relations with the chief minister of India's Tamil Nadu State, M.G. Ramachandran, until the latter's death in 1987. Until India's intervention in 1987, he could count upon at least the moral support of Ramachandran's political party, the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Some of the LTTE's militant rivals maintained ties with the Tamil Nadu opposition party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which was headed by Ramachandran's bitter rival, M. Karunaidhi. Other Tamil Groups Observers in the late 1980s counted at least thirty separate guerrilla groups of which five, including the LTTE, were the most important. The other four major groups were the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), led by K. Padmanabha, the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), led by Sri Sabaratnam until he was killed by the LTTE assassins in May 1986, the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students (EROS), led by V. Balakumar, and the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), headed by Uma Maheswaran. These groups differed significantly in terms of strategies and ideologies. EROS was said to prefer acts of economic sabotage. In March 1985, the LTTE, EPRLF, TELO, and EROS formed a united front organization, the Eelam National Liberation Front (ENLF). PLOTE, probably the most genuinely Marxist-Leninist of the five major guerrilla groups, remained outside the coalition. By mid-1986, ENLF had become largely inoperative after the LTTE quit, although the other groups sought to form a front without its participation. The Liberation Tigers proceeded to devour their rivals during 1986 and 1987. TELO was decimated in 1986 by repeated LTTE attacks. During 1987 the Tigers battled not only Indian troops but members of PLOTE and the EPRLF. The year 1983 can be regarded as a psychological turning point in the ethnic crisis. The brutal anti-Tamil riots of July in Colombo and other towns, and the government's apparent lack of concern for Tamil safety and welfare seemed to rule out a peaceful resolution of differences between Tamils and Sinhalese. The riots were touched off by the July 23 killing of thirteen Sinhalese soldiers by LTTE guerrillas on the Jaffna Peninsula. According to Tambiah, the mutilated corpses were brought to Colombo by their comrades and displayed at a cemetery as an example of the Tigers' barbarism. In an explosion of rage, local Sinhalese began attacks on Tamils and their property that spread out from Colombo District to other districts and resulted in at least 400 casualties (the official figure) and perhaps as many as 2,000 (an estimate by Tamil sources). Fifty-three Tamil prisoners were killed under questionable circumstances at the Welikade Prison outside Colombo. Damage to property, including Tamil-owned shops and factories, was initially estimated at the equivalent of US$150 million, probably a low figure. The authorities, seemingly paralyzed during the bloody days of July 24 to July 31, did little or nothing to protect the victims of mob violence. Curfews were not enforced by security personnel even though they were required under a nationwide state of emergency in effect since the May by-elections. Jayewardene withdrew to his presidential residence, heavily guarded by government troops, and issued a statement after the riots that &quot;the time has come to accede to the clamor and the national respect of the Sinhala People,&quot; that expressed little sympathy for the sufferings of the Tamils. There was ample evidence, reported in the Indian and Western media, that the violence was more a carefully planned program than a totally spontaneous expression of popular indignation. According to a report in the New Delhi publication, India Today , &quot;the mobs were armed with voters' lists, and detailed addresses of every Tamil-owned shop, house, or factory, and their attacks were very precise.&quot; Other sources mentioned the central role played by Minister of Industry and Scientific Affairs Cyril Mathew in providing personnel for the violence and the ease with which the mobs found transportation, including government vehicles, to move from place to place. According to political scientist James Manor, the eagerness of powerful politicians such as Mathew to stir up ethnic trouble stemmed at least in part from factional struggles within the ruling UNP. Mathew reportedly used the riots to compromise the aging and seemingly indecisive Jayewardene and undermine support for the chief executive's all-but-designated successor, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. According to India Today reporting in August 1983, five UNP factional groups, including Mathew's and Premadasa's, competed for influence. With deep reservoirs of anti-Tamil sentiment among poorer Sinhalese to draw upon, Mathew could not be ignored in any post-Jayewardene political arrangement within the UNP. His schemes, however, ultimately backfired. In December 1984, Mathew was obliged to resign from the cabinet for opposing negotiations between the government and the Tamils on regional autonomy, and he subsequently faced expulsion from the party. The 1983 violence had a caste as well as ethnic dimension. Mathew was a leader of the Vahumpura caste. This group has a lower status than the politically dominant Goyigama caste but comprises more than one-third of the Sinhalese population. Traditionally, Vahumpura occupations included the making of jaggery (brown sugar derived from palm sap) and domestic service in higher caste households. Nevertheless, they trace their descent from the attendants of Mahinda, the brother or son of the Indian emperor Asoka, who came to Sri Lanka as a Buddhist missionary in the third century B.C. and thus claimed an",

'However sad it is, I must say that Abkhazian authorities made a big blunder,' Shevardnadze said of the Abkhazia region's move to free itself from Tbilisi. 'The main thing is that it was absolutely unexpected to us.' Just as peacekeeping troops brought an enforced quiet to the conflict in northern Georgia's Ossetian territory, western Georgia's Abkhazian region declared its independence. 'I, you know, had to interrupt a very important trip to western Georgia because I'm afraid that the consequences may be difficult,' Shevardnadze said in a television interview after the government ruled Abkhazian actions invalid. Shevardnadze said the government would 'look for ways of settling this problem. It's almost a dead-end situation.' While Abkhazia was making noises about breaking away from Georgia, Shevardnadze was touring western Georgia cities that remain a bastion of support for ousted Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia and Shevardnadze was met with heckling wherever he went. While all this was going on, shooting erupted near Shevardnadze's Tbilisi home and bandits stopped the Tbilisi-Moscow train at a Georgian junction and robbed passengers in four cars, according to the Russian Itar-Tass news agency. All this came as Georgia prepared to receive top British and Turkish ministers next week. Georgia has been almost continuously rocked by one conflict or another since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. After the breakup, when the other 11 republics formed the Commonwealth of Independent States, Georgia decided against joining. In the latest conflict in the western Georgia region bordering the Black Sea, an Abkhazian legislature voted to restore a 1925 Abkhazian constitution making Abkhazia 'a sovereign state, exercising state power over its territory independently from any other power.' Abkhazian parliamentary leader Vladislav Ardzinba said in a Saturday television broadcast that Abkhazian 'will discuss the question of resuming normal international relations' with Georgia. Earlier at a news conference in Sukhumi, the main Abkhazian city, Ardzinba talked about 'the republic's aspiration toward full sovereignty' and called for 'negotiations between Abkhazia and Georgia on equal rights.' Another Abkhazian political faction announced its opposition to the independence movement, and Shevardnadze complained the breakaway faction acted 'without considering the opinion of the majority of Abkhasian population.' The growth of Abkhazian nationalism in western Georgia comes as Shevardnadze seeks to quell pro-Gamsakhurdia feelings in the region. Gun-toting guards accompanied Shevardnadze on his tour of western Georgia this week, but crowds waved pictures of the ousted president and heckled his replacement. Shevardnadze was the former communist ruler of Georgia who joined Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's reform government in Moscow as foreign minister. He returned to Georgia this year after Gamsakhurdia -- a dissident during Shevardnadze's Georgia tenure -- was forcefully removed from power by people who said Georgia's first popularly elected president had become a dictator. Georgia's one bright spot was in Ossetia, where peacekeepers completing their second week of duty have enforced a truce, even though a political solution has been more elusive. South Ossetian has voted to secede from Georgia and join North Ossetia in neighboring Russia. The joint Russian-Georgian-Ossetian peacekeeping force has ended a year of fighting, allowing refugees to begin returning. Earlier in the week, Georgian national guard leader Tengis Kitovani said that if Georgia gave in to all its ethnic minorities demanding independence, 'then nothing would be left of Georgia.'

Shevardnadze, who has been struggling since March to stabilize a turbulent Georgia and give it some international credibility, is now facing a maze of conflicts that threaten both Georgia&#x27;s integrity as a unified state and his own as a man of peace. Militia loyal to the deposed President, Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia, continue to disrupt western Georgia, while two other regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, are trying to secede. A Georgian military occupation of the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, only reluctantly supported by Mr. Shevardnadze, has not put an end to resistance, and Georgia&#x27;s main railway link to Russia and Armenia has now been cut, deepening an economic crisis. Though Mr. Shevardnadze was invited to return to head the provisional State Council after Mr. Gamsakhurdia was driven out in January, he is not in full command of what he himself, in an interview, called &quot;a semi-legitimate, semi-Government.&quot; His diplomatic charm and civilized manner, so much admired in the West, have proved less effective in Georgia, which has become used to a romanticized culture of violence and where lots of unshaven young men feel improperly dressed without a sidearm or Kalashnikov rifle. Elections Due in October Mr. Shevardnadze&#x27;s chief aides see dangers from the freewheeling and powerful Defense Minister, Tengiz Kitovani, who led the army into Abkhazia and has returned a national hero. Mr. Kitovani was instrumental in the return of Mr. Shevardnadze, who ran Georgia for 14 years for the Communist Party before becoming Soviet Foreign Minister. Mr. Shevardnadze has his eye on parliamentary elections scheduled for Oct. 11, by which he intends to bring Georgia back to legitimate government while providing himself a real mandate. The elections were initially opposed by Mr. Kitovani. A nation of about 5.5 million people with an economy based largely on light industry, wine and tea, Georgia is torn by the kinds of ethnic conflicts that are occurring all along the southern rim of the former Soviet Union. Mr. Shevardnadze and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, have worked out an imaginative peacekeeping effort in tiny South Ossetia, whose capital, Tskhinvali, is now calm after being largely destroyed. But Abkhazia, a republic of some 550,000 people on the Black Sea in western Georgia, is proving both messy and embarrassing. The chairman of its Parliament, Vladislav Ardzinba, declared independence last month and spurned reconciliation talks. High-level Georgian negotiators, including the Interior Minister and security chief, were taken hostage. Georgian troops sent to secure the highway and railroad, where one of every 10 trains had been robbed, were attacked and at least 30 people were killed. 100 Killed in Conflict Mr. Kitovani and the army moved in and occupied Sukhumi, raising the maroon Georgian flag over the Parliament and government buildings. But two bridges were blown up, cutting the railroad altogether. Mr. Ardzinba has gone to ground and simultaneously calls for resistance and new negotiations. Altogether, at least 100 people have died, and sniper fire continues nightly in Sukhumi. Mr. Shevardnadze, who preferred negotiation, now says wanly: &quot;There was no other way out here. When a person sees he must choose the lesser evil, he must decide. If we didn&#x27;t do this, the outcome would have been worse.&quot; Toying with a pen and speaking softly, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think any state would have put up with this.&quot; Pressed about whether Mr. Kitovani had exceeded his instructions, Mr. Shevardnadze sighed and finally said, &quot;I think there was no necessity to seize the Parliament building and the Council of Ministers.&quot; His closest aide, Sergei Tarasenko, was much blunter. &quot;It was the most stupid thing to do,&quot; he said. &quot;If there is a government in Abkhazia it&#x27;s easier to talk, and now they&#x27;ve disappeared.&quot; In fact, Mr. Tarasenko said, &quot;the military campaign gained nothing, and it&#x27;s even a worse situation than before.&quot; Not only is the railroad cut and Mr. Ardzinba gone to ground, he said, Mr. Kitovani returns &quot;as a national hero, which creates a political problem.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know how this situation can be resolved,&quot; Mr. Tarasenka said. &quot;Anything can happen.&quot; But another close Shevardnadze friend, Chabua Amiredzhibi, a 71-year-old writer and former dissident who serves on the State Council, said that Mr. Tarasenko&#x27;s concerns were exaggerated. . He said there was no open struggle with Mr. Kitovani, &quot;an overambitious person who overestimates his own capacities.&quot; He &quot;wants the same Georgia as Shevardnadze does,&quot; Mr. Amiredzhibi said, &quot;but he thinks he must achieve this by different means, by force.&quot; Mr. Shevardnadze &quot;can play any role,&quot; said Mr. Amiredzhibi, who admires him enormously. &quot;He came to a country where a rope is already hanging from a gallows and he inserted his head into the loop. Only a strong and self-confident person could do this.&quot; Abkhazia Seeks Support Mr. Shevardnadze is known here as &quot;the white fox&quot; because of his craftiness, and some Western diplomats believe he is well served by Mr. Kitovani&#x27;s acts in the Abkhazia problem, at least if it soon calms down. Georgian officials stress that Abkhazians now make up only 18 percent of Abkhazia&#x27;s population, while Georgians make up 46 percent, and even a political quota system favoring Abkhazians was apparently insufficient for Mr. Ardzinba. Abkhazia has been seeking support from a loosely defined group of Caucasus peoples who want to form a Trans- Caucasus republic. The group, which has no support from Russia, said on Saturday that it would send armed volunteers into Georgia to carry out attacks in Tbilisi. Mr. Shevardnadze said Georgia would respond as necessary. Georgia&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Aleksandr D. Chikvaidze, concedes that Soviet policy encouraged Abkhazian autonomy to weaken Georgian nationalism. &quot;Big brother encouraged them, but now it&#x27;s different,&quot; he said. &quot;Russia has its own problems with Chechenya and Tatarstan,&quot; Russian areas seeking autonomy or independence, and shares Georgia&#x27;s intention to preserve its current borders. On Friday, Mr. Yeltsin called for a peaceful solution based on Georgia&#x27;s territorial integrity and said Russia would not intervene. Mr. Kitovani&#x27;s seeming success has created difficulties for Mr. Shevardnadze, who is trying to strip him of control over the police and Interior Ministry troops. &quot;Kitovani went beyond the authorization given to him and has returned a national hero,&quot; a senior Western diplomat said. &quot;Shevardnadze is in the position where he can&#x27;t easily admit that he tried to limit the military action, or that he did not know the troops would move all the way up to the Russian border.&quot; In the interview, Mr. Shevardnadze said that he and Mr. Kitovani were &quot;not homogeneous,&quot; but added: &quot;Each of us has his own function. We&#x27;re on a temporary basis here. We&#x27;ll hold elections and everything will be clearly defined.&quot; Asked if Mr. Kitovani was now a national hero, he laughed softly and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great victory. What kind of victory is this? What kind of hero? It was on our native soil.&quot; Mr. Tarasenko said Mr. Shevardnadze and the patched-together state had few levers of power to pull. After the elections, however, &quot;he&#x27;ll have a mandate and government legitimacy and then he can be more resolute,&quot; he said. Asked if he is glad he returned to Georgia, Mr. Shevardnadze, 64 and tired after 18-hour days, said simply: &quot;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m glad I came. That&#x27;s not the word. I don&#x27;t know the outcome, but I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;m here in the most difficult days for my motherland. I&#x27;m here with the Georgian people.&quot; A version of this article appears in print on , Section A , Page 3 of the National edition with the headline: As Georgia Chief, Shevardnadze Rides Whirlwind .

    "source_text": "Egypt to assist international Gaza flotilla Advertisement EGYPT has agreed to allow an international flotilla targeting Israel&apos;s maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip to unload its cargo at the nearby port of El-Arish and transfer it into the Palestinian enclave over land. The flotilla of at least eight ships is scheduled to set sail from a handful of Mediterranean ports, but is not expected to reach waters off Gaza until later next week. People wave Palestinian flags in support rally in Turkey. AFP At a meeting of Israel&apos;s security cabinet on Sunday, navy chief Eliezer Marom briefed on plans to block the flotilla. &apos;&apos;Last year&apos;s flotilla and other surprises that await us this time have been taken into consideration, and Israel is better prepared this time,&apos;&apos; he reportedly said. Last May, Israeli naval commandos killed nine people when they stopped another protest flotilla in international waters off the coast of Gaza. A UN committee that investigated Israel&apos;s use of force to block the flotilla is expected to issue a report at the end of next week. Advertisement With some 350 passengers from 22 countries, including Australia, expected to join the flotilla, Israel&apos;s Government Press Office issued a statement on Sunday warning that foreign journalists who joined the flotilla faced being barred entry to Israel for 10 years. &apos;&apos;I would like to make it clear to you and to the media that you represent, that participation in the flotilla is an intentional violation of Israeli law and is liable to lead to participants being denied entry into the State of Israel for 10 years, to the impoundment of their equipment and to additional sanctions,&apos;&apos; the statement read. It is understood that the director of the GPO, Oren Helman, was handed the letter on Sunday morning by an official in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s office and ordered to issue it in his name. &apos;&apos;This was not Oren&apos;s idea, he knew this would be counter-productive and that it would only … further darken foreign perceptions of Israel as a deeply flawed democracy. &apos;&apos;For a Prime Minister that prides himself on sophisticated hasbara (public relations), this was a clumsy error,&apos;&apos; a Foreign Ministry source told The Age . The Foreign Press Association of Israel condemned Israel&apos;s threat to punish journalists. &apos;&apos;Journalists covering a legitimate news event should be allowed to do their jobs without threats and intimidation. We urge the government to reverse its decision immediately,&apos;&apos; the FPA statement said. Save You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

[1] The true amount of military and civil casualties suffered by both sides is one of Russia's best kept secrets. Numbers vary wildly. However, the Russian Interior Minister Kulikov claimed that during the first Chechen war (1994-1996) fewer than 20.000 civilians were killed while then-Secretary of the National Security Council Aleksander Lebed asserted that 80.000 to 100.000 had been killed and 240.000 had been injured. Chechen spokesman claim that the true numbers are even higher. Human rights groups estimate that over 4.300 soldiers from the federal forces were killed. Estimates on the second Chechen war (August 1999 - March 2000), and on the subsequent guerrilla warfare lasting to our days, are contradictory. But according to Artyom Vernidoub of the Russian Gazeta, the Interfax Defence Minstry has published unofficial data confirming that at March 2000, 2331 military servicemen died from the hand of Chechen separatists, whereas a November 2001 Kremlin report already spoke of 3438 killed. Other sources report much higher losses. Russia said its forces had killed more than 12.000 rebels in separatist Chechnya since August 1999. In response, Human Rights Watch and other humanitarian groups called the figures grossly exaggerated. Data on the loss of civilians are unknown but must be comparable at least to those of the first Chechen war, if not higher. Human rights groups estimate 20.000. So, for the period from 1994 to 2002 estimates range from 40.000 to 120.000 civilians. Given that almost certainly both sides have tended to exaggerate enemy military casualties while minimizing their own and grossly underestimating its responsibility for civilian losses, setting the death toll, from the beginning of the first war to present days, at 70.000-90.000 civilians, about 10.000 Russian soldiers and at least the same amount of Chechen rebels, is a plausible (and possibly even a too conservative) estimate. If so, the war in Chechnya results much more costly than Afghanistan. See for instance a report by the Federation of American Scientists about a military analysis on the first and second war in Chechnya . Also: Russia accused of killing 20.000 Chechen civilians .

Of them 18,000 live in tent refugee camps, according to the official figures collected within the recent All-Russian census. While the vast majority of internally displaced persons from Chechnya are living in Ingushetia, about 5,000 are believed to be in Dagestan, and between 5,000 and 7,000 are believed to be refugees in Georgia. Because refugees in Georgia have not been registered, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of this estimate. Many others live in Russia or are &quot;scattered&quot; throughout the world.

[18] From a statement of Olivier Dupuis at the European Parliament sitting of Wednesday, 10 April 2002. [19] President Aslan Maskhadov came to power with an overwhelming majority as the head of a regularly and democratically elected government in 1997 (the regularity of this election was monitored and confirmed by different international independent organization, among others the OSCE). Also the Russian government recognized Makhadov as the legitimate President. However, after the beginning of the second war in Chechnya, in 1999, Maskhadov, and all his ministers, had to retire and operate clandestinely, and some of them had been imprisoned or fled in exile. Especially after the October 2002 hostage taking in Moscow's theater they are all accused by Moscow's authorities to be directly or indirectly involved in terrorist attacks. So far however no reliable evidence of Maskhadov's, or one of his ministers, involvement in intentional attacks on civilians could be demonstrated. On his side Maskhadov, who continues to operate in the Chechen territory through guerrilla warfare, rejects these accusations and condemns, as he has always done, any form of terrorism and asserts that he continues to appeal for a peaceful nonviolent solution of the conflict and remains open to a political discussion. So long there will be no new regular elections and Maskahdov's government continues to appeal for a nonviolent political solution, he and his ministers are so far the only possible regular representatives of the Chechen population. [20] The word &quot;radical&quot; should not suggest some form of &quot;extremism&quot; or &quot;fundamentalism&quot;. The TRP is a transnational but originally an Italian political party. The word &quot;radical&quot; is the unfortunate translation of the Italian word &quot;radicale&quot; which is the adjective of &quot;radice&quot; (from the Latin &quot;radix&quot;), which in English means &quot;root&quot;. In this context to be a &quot;radicale&quot; means to be someone who tries to find out the &quot;root&quot; of the problems. A political radical is looking for the ultimate cause, i.e. the &quot;root&quot; of a political problem. Exactly the opposite of the extremism and fundamentalism. [21] Our main, even if not exclusive, source of information are the press releases, articles and news reaching the Yahoo group Chechnya list, moderated by Norbert Strade. Another source are the Transnational Radical Party (TRP) [20] press releases (These are only some of the many possible examples one can find and are, in any case, not intended to promote a particular political party or movement. However, fact is that Olivier Dupuis, a member of the European Parliament, and other members of the TRP are actively investigating on the EU's political attitude towards Russia, making particularly revealing discoveries). [22] According to an ITAR-TASS (19-12-2002), t he Kremlin's representative to the Southern Federal District, Viktor Kazantsev, said that &quot;more than 400,000 Russian-speaking people have left Chechnya&quot;. Instead according to the Moscow News (No. 49, Dec. 2002), Dmitry Pushkar claims that &quot;before Dudayev came to power, there were approximately 230,000 ethnic Russians living in Chechnya.&quot; [23] About the journalists and relief workers abductions or death click here .",

Mission&#13; in Congo (MONUC) Reaction of&#13; the RCD to UN Initiatives U.N.&#13; Commissioner On Human Rights The Present&#13; Situation VII. &#13; ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I. SUMMARY In mid-May 2002 soldiers and police&#13; officers in Kisangani, the third largest city in the Democratic Republic of&#13; Congo (DRC), mutinied against their commanding officers and the local&#13; authorities of the Congolese Rally for Democracy, Goma faction (RCD). [1] &#13; The RCD depends on the military and political support of neighboring Rwanda to&#13; exercise control over some thirty to forty percent of eastern Congo. The&#13; mutineers took control of the radio station and called on the population to&#13; join them in hunting down and expelling \"Rwandans,\" apparently meaning both&#13; citizens of Rwanda and Congolese of Rwandan origin. Mutineers and civilian&#13; crowds killed six persons who were or were thought to be Rwandan. Loyalist RCD soldiers quickly put&#13; down the mutiny. After the arrival of reinforcements from Goma, RCD soldiers&#13; carried out indiscriminate killings of civilians, summary executions of&#13; military personnel and civilians, numerous rapes, beatings, and widespread&#13; looting. Almost immediately after the&#13; reinforcements and their commanders arrived from Goma, RCD soldiers entered the&#13; civilian neighborhood of Mangobo, killing dozens of civilians, committing&#13; numerous rapes, and systematically looting the neighborhood. At the same time,&#13; a large number of Congolese military and police personnel suspected of&#13; involvement in the mutiny were arrested, and most were summarily executed on&#13; the nights of May 14 and May 15 at the Tshopo bridge, their bodies thrown in&#13; the river. Many of those bodies, some horribly mutilated and put in&#13; weighted-down sacks, later resurfaced. Other killings and executions took&#13; place in additional locations, including an abandoned brewery, the Bangboka&#13; airport, and the military barracks at Camp Ketele. Human Rights Watch research was&#13; able to establish the identities of the RCD officers implicated in these&#13; abuses, which amount to war crimes. According to the witnesses we interviewed,&#13; Bernard Biamungu, commander of the Fifth Brigade; Gabriel Amisi, also known as&#13; Tango Fort, the assistant chief of staff for logistics; and Laurent Nkunda, the&#13; commander of the Seventh Brigade, were among the RCD officers who arrived from&#13; Goma, to take charge of putting down the mutiny. These officers appear to have&#13; been on the scene of many of these crimes, in a position to know of them, and&#13; in some cases asserted below, directing or participating in them. Many other&#13; Kisangani-based RCD officers also played a direct role in the abuses documented&#13; in this report. The United Nations Mission in the&#13; Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) had dozens of military observers and some&#13; one thousand troops to defend U.N. personnel in Kisangani at the time. Although&#13; the MONUC mandate authorized it to intervene \"to protect civilians under&#13; imminent threat of physical violence,\" MONUC officers did not send their&#13; military observers on patrol to deter killings on the first day of RCD&#13; violence. The U.N. should review MONUC's actions during the Kisangani&#13; massacre. In particular, a U.N. inquiry should determine whether MONUC had the&#13; military means to carry out its protection mandate, and whether MONUC&#13; commanders believed they could count on the support of the troop-contributing&#13; nations when carrying out their mandate and risking the lives of MONUC&#13; personnel. On the second day, MONUC officers appealed for restraint, obtained&#13; the release of two detained priests, and protected seven other civilians. In the course of research, Human&#13; Rights Watch documented the deaths of more than eighty persons in the mutiny&#13; and subsequent repression. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,&#13; summary or arbitrary executions carried out an inquiry into these same events&#13; and estimated in a report presented to the U.N. Security Council by the High&#13; Commissioner for Human Rights on July 16 that RCD officers had been responsible&#13; for the deaths of more than 160 persons. Determining the final death toll will&#13; be possible only when families of victims, now fearful of authorities, have&#13; sufficient confidence to report all deaths. In mid-July 2002 the U.N. Security&#13; Council demanded that the RCD bring perpetrators of the Kisangani massacre to&#13; justice. With the publication of this report, Human Rights Watch provides&#13; information to help make this possible by identifying the chain of command that&#13; links together those responsible for the Kisangani massacre. Much of the information in this&#13; report is based on the testimony of one or more eyewitnesses to the crimes&#13; described. Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed these eyewitnesses&#13; privately and independently, without their knowledge of the testimony of other&#13; witnesses, and tried to verify the accuracy of their accounts with&#13; corroborating information whenever possible. For their safety, we have&#13; withheld their names and details necessary to protect their identities. &#13; Because of the severe security situation in Kisangani, Human Rights Watch was&#13; unable to include other eyewitness testimony because the identity of those&#13; witnesses could be easily ascertained, placing their lives at risk. These&#13; accounts, on file at Human Rights Watch, provide further corroboration of the&#13; interviews we did use in this report. II. RECOMMENDATIONS To the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma · Cease immediately all attacks on civilians and other violations&#13; of international humanitarian law. · Investigate the violations of international humanitarian law documented&#13; in this report and bring to account, in accordance with international standards&#13; of justice, those found responsible for wrongdoing. · Cease immediately all intimidation of human rights groups and&#13; other civil society organizations operating in areas under your control.&#13; Provide full access to national and international human rights organizations,&#13; independent journalists, and U.N. investigators to investigate reports of human&#13; rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in areas under your&#13; control. · Make public the number of those still detained in connection with&#13; the aborted mutiny, their names, and whereabouts. To the Government of Rwanda · Direct the military prosecutor to investigate the alleged&#13; participation of soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army in the crimes&#13; documented in this report and bring to trial, in accordance with international&#13; standards of justice, any against whom credible evidence is found. · Order Rwandan troops deployed in Congo to comply with the Geneva&#13; Conventions of 1949 and Protocol I of 1977, and in particular to provide for&#13; the security of the civilian population and of humanitarian workers in areas&#13; under Rwandan control. To the United Nations Security Council · Provide MONUC with the means to protect civilians within areas of&#13; their deployment, as specified in its mandate. · Increase the number of MONUC human rights officers and the&#13; resources at their disposal so they can effectively investigate and publicly&#13; report on human rights abuses by all the parties to the conflict. They should&#13; identify perpetrators of abuses, inform the relevant disciplinary and judicial&#13; authorities, and monitor efforts to hold them accountable. · Investigate whether MONUC troops failed to implement their&#13; mandate to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical danger at&#13; Mangobo district of Kisangani on May 14, 2002. Publish the results of the&#13; inquiry. In particular, the U.N. inquiry should determine whether MONUC had&#13; the military means to carry out its protection mandate, and whether MONUC&#13; commanders believed they could count on the support of the troop-contributing&#13; nations when carrying out their mandate and risking the lives of MONUC&#13; personnel. · Ensure that any person responsible for violations of&#13; international humanitarian law and other grave abuses be excluded from the&#13; civilian police training now being offered by MONUC in Kisangani. · Establish a U.N. Commission of Experts to investigate and&#13; determine responsibility for grave violations of human rights and humanitarian&#13; law in Congo, thus implementing a 1998 recommendation of the U.N. Secretary&#13; General's Investigative Team in the DRC. To complete the work the team was&#13; prevented from doing, the commission should have a mandate for the period&#13; beginning in 1993 and continuing to the present. The Commission of Experts&#13; should also be charged with recommending to the Security Council an appropriate&#13; mechanism for bringing to justice persons responsible for violations. To the United Nations&#13; Commission on Human Rights · Support the strengthening of the human rights monitoring capacity&#13; of MONUC and institute closer cooperation between that division and the High&#13; Commissioner for Human Rights Field Office in the Democratic Republic of Congo. · Increase the monitoring and technical assistance programs of the&#13; High Commissioner's Field Office throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo. To the International Community · Strongly and publicly denounce violations of international human&#13; rights and humanitarian law by all parties to the Congo war and insist upon&#13; accountability for the perpetrators as an integral part of any peace&#13; negotiations. · Support increased monitoring and technical assistance programs by&#13; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Field&#13; Office throughout Congo. · Press Rwanda to investigate and bring to justice any of its&#13; soldiers accused of violating international humanitarian law or other serious&#13; abuses in Congo. · Make economic assistance to all the states involved in the Congo&#13; war subject to close s",

Fadel Senna—AFP/Getty Images Ideas By Yonatan Touval October 31, 2023 4:50 PM EDT Touval is a senior policy analyst with Mitvim: The Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies *:not(.inline-image)]:px-4 [&>*:not(.inline-image)]:lg:pl-[6.5rem] [&>*:not(.inline-image)]:lg:pr-14 [&>.inline-image]:sm:px-4 [&>.inline-image]:lg:pl-[6.5rem] [&>.inline-image]:lg:pr-14\"> A s we enter into the fourth week of the Israel-Hamas war, a clear endgame for the war Israel launched in retaliation for the massacre of October 7 remains elusive. The absence of well-defined Israeli goals may have been understandable at the initial stages of the war given the enormous shock at Hamas’s ability to perpetrate a surprise attack on such a wide scale and the desire for vengeance in view of Hamas’ barbaric atrocities against thousands of Israelis. Yet shock and vengeance are no substitutes for strategy, and the ground operations that Israel launched inside the Gaza Strip rapidly hasten the need to plan for the day after the invasion ends. A hint of Washington’s impatience with Israel’s failure to spell out its intentions was already evident in President Biden’s remarks in Tel Aviv on October 18, when Biden publicly noted that wartime success “requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives.” Since then, but for a vaguely worded statement by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that Israel seeks “the creation of a new security regime in the Gaza Strip, the removal of Israel’s responsibility for day-to-day life in the Gaza Strip, and the creation of a new security reality for the citizens of Israel,” no clear vision for what Israel aims to achieve has been presented. The apparent absence of an Israeli vision for how to realize its goals and the growing escalation of the conflict across the region require urgent international intervention aimed at preparing the diplomatic off-ramp that must be the end of all wars. The off-ramp would need to contend with multiple challenges, including those underlying Israel's own war objectives. First, the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, which Israel has repeatedly declared to be its main objective, lacks the clarity of purpose and the certainty of its achievability. Hamas is an organization deeply embedded in Gaza’s social and civilian life, and destroying it would require not only the killing of tens of thousands of armed men affiliated with Hamas, but also dismantling its wide array of civilian mechanisms—mechanism that employ upwards of 40,000 civilians and which are essential if Gaza is to function after the war ends. Second, even as Israel’s war objective of dismantling Hamas is probably unrealistic, it is also, paradoxically, not ambitious enough. This is because disarming Hamas would create a power vacuum into which other militant and terrorist groups would enter – principally Palestinian Islamic Jihad, but potentially also other militant groups, including Salafi-jihadist ones. These groups are no less committed to waging endless war on Israel, and their weakness relative to Hamas thus far has been due to Hamas’s ability to rein them in. If Hamas is weakened, let alone dismantled, they will likely take its place. Read More: The Invasion of Gaza Will Not Make Israel Safer And finally, a war whose goal is destroying Hamas does not necessarily go in hand with securing the release of the roughly 240 Israeli hostages in Gaza. If anything, the kind of brutal and bloody fighting required to achieve the dismantling of Hamas would only endanger the lives and safety of the Israeli hostages rather than expedite or assure their release. The fact, moreover, that third-party negotiations can bring about the release of hostages, as has already been demonstrated by the release of four hostages in two separate deals brokered by both Qatar and Egypt, underscores the availability of an alternative to the use of sheer military force. The diplomatic off-ramp must be nothing less than a regional grand bargain—one that would address Israel’s necessary and legitimate strategic needs; strengthen the pragmatic Palestinian forces who are willing to reach a permanent agreement with Israel; avert a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip; and prevent a wider regional war. The challenge, admittedly, is enormous and may well be beyond what regional and international diplomacy can pull off. Competing interests among some of the key regional stakeholders (such as between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Qatar) and powerful spoilers—notably Iran, Hamas’s chief sponsor—are bound to get in the way. Yet given the enormous stakes at hand, the effort must be made, with these two primary components at its core: First and immediately, an “all-for-all” hostages for prisoners exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. Under such a deal, Hamas and the other Palestinian groups would release all Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for a blanket release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, estimated at around 6,000. The Israeli hostages would include the two civilians who have been held by Hamas before October 7. Even if Hamas were to release several dozen captives in the days to come, the staggering number of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip renders any precedents to prisoner exchange deals—notably that of the 2011 deal for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, where the identity and severity of each and every prisoner’s security crimes were factored in—moot. Second, and in the longer term, the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. This should be Israel’s ultimate goal, but it is also one that only a concerted regional and international effort might be able to bring about without a full-scale ground invasion.

While such efforts have failed in the past, conditions this time are different. Achieving this goal, however, would depend on the creation of a coalition of regional stakeholders united by the understanding that Hamas must be eliminated—indeed, that failure to destroy Hamas would deal a major victory to their arch enemy, Iran. Such a potential coalition exists in the region, with key players being Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Tragically, the military disarmament of Hamas and all other Palestinian factions will probably not be achieved without additional military pressure, with all the implications for the civilian population of Gaza, along with some kind of a (literally) life-saving deal for Hamas’s and PIJ’s leaderships, whoever among them survives. Historical examples for such arrangements are none too inspiring, but the 1982 evacuation of Yasser Arafat and the PLO from Beirut, Lebanon, could serve as a model. The military disarmament of Hamas and all other Palestinian factions must also mean the readiness of the Palestinian Authority, under the leadership of the PLO (and its main faction, Fatah) to assume control over the Gaza Strip. Such a development would require considerable political and financial resources, and might necessitate the establishment of a multinational Arab peacekeeping force that would, under optimal circumstances, receive its mandate from a U.N. Security Council resolution. As for the financial component, the wealthy Arab states, principally Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, and the European donor countries, would need to foot the bill. These are only the two basic components of the regional bargain required right now. A broader deal, one that would truly redefine the regional security architecture (and also go a long way in checking Iran’s regional ambitions) might also include American defense pacts with both Israel and Saudi Arabia, Saudi-Israeli normalization, and a joint U.S. and Saudi sponsored Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a two-state solution. The prospect for renewed Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a two-state solution might seem extremely distant under present circumstances. Yet the trauma of October 7 and the pain engendered by the ongoing crisis may create the kind of willingness, on both sides, that has been lacking in the past 20 years. To be sure, good-faith negotiations would require new leaderships in both Jerusalem and Ramallah that enjoy broad public support. In Israel, that might possible even with the current parliamentary makeup (provided Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped down and a new coalition is formed). In Palestine, where elections in the Palestinian Authority have not taken place since 2006 and are unlikely to take place any time soon, the legitimacy would need to be achieved through internal organizational reforms as well as through major economic reconstruction and assistance by way of a Marshall Plan-like support from the outside. Meanwhile, the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the consolidation of a Palestinian polity would mean the removal of one of the main obstacles to such negotiations since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007. There is no easy path forward, but the urgency for regional and global diplomacy cannot be overstated. Failure to create an off-ramp from this war would mean not simply more of the same, but a precipitous fall into the abyss.
